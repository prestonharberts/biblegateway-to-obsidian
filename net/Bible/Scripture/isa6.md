## Isaiah’s Commission
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>In the year of King Uzziah’s death, I saw the Lord seated on a high, elevated throne. The hem of his robe filled the temple.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>Seraphs stood over him; each one had six wings. With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and they used the remaining two to fly.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>They called out to one another, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies! His majestic splendor fills the entire earth!”
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>The sound of their voices shook the door frames, and the temple was filled with smoke.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>I said, “Woe to me! I am destroyed, for my lips are contaminated by sin, and I live among people whose lips are contaminated by sin. My eyes have seen the king, the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies.”

###### 6
<span class=verse-first>6</span>But then one of the seraphs flew toward me. In his hand was a hot coal he had taken from the altar with tongs.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>He touched my mouth with it and said, “Look, this coal has touched your lips. Your evil is removed; your sin is forgiven.”
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>I heard the voice of the Lord say, “Whom will I send? Who will go on our behalf?” I answered, “Here I am, send me!”
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>He said, “Go and tell these people:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>‘Listen continually, but don’t understand.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look continually, but don’t perceive.’
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Make the hearts of these people calloused;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Make their ears deaf and their eyes blind.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Otherwise they might see with their eyes and hear with their ears,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their hearts might understand and they might repent and be healed.”
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>I replied, “How long, Lord?” He said,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Until cities are in ruins and unpopulated,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And houses are uninhabited,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the land is ruined and devastated,
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the Lᴏʀᴅ has sent the people off to a distant place,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the very heart of the land is completely abandoned.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even if only a tenth of the people remain in the land,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will again be destroyed,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like one of the large sacred trees or an Asherah pole,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When a sacred pillar on a high place is thrown down.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That sacred pillar symbolizes the special chosen family.”
