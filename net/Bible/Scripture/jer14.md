## A Lament over the Ravages of Drought
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>This was the Lᴏʀᴅ’s message to Jeremiah about the drought.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The people of Judah are in mourning.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The people in her cities are pining away.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They lie on the ground expressing their sorrow.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Cries of distress come up to me from Jerusalem.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The leading men of the cities send their servants for water.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They go to the cisterns, but they do not find any water there.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They return with their containers empty.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Disappointed and dismayed, they bury their faces in their hands.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are dismayed because the ground is cracked
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because there has been no rain in the land.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The farmers, too, are dismayed
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And bury their faces in their hands.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even the doe abandons her newborn fawn in the field
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because there is no grass.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Wild donkeys stand on the hilltops
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And pant for breath like jackals.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their eyes are strained looking for food,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because there is none to be found.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>Then I said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ, intervene for the honor of your name
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even though our sins speak out against us.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, we have turned away from you many times.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We have sinned against you.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You have been the object of Israel’s hopes.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You have saved them when they were in trouble.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why have you become like a resident foreigner in the land?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why have you become like a traveler who only stops in to spend the night?
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why should you be like someone who is helpless,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a champion who cannot save anyone?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You are indeed with us,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And we belong to you.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not abandon us!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>Then the Lᴏʀᴅ spoke about these people.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They truly love to go astray.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They cannot keep from running away from me.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So I am not pleased with them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will now call to mind the wrongs they have done
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And punish them for their sins.”
## Judgment for Believing the Misleading Lies of the False Prophets
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>Then the Lᴏʀᴅ said to me, “Do not pray for good to come to these people!
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>“Even if they fast, I will not hear their cries for help. Even if they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them. Instead, I will kill them through wars, famines, and plagues.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>Then I said, “Oh, Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ, look! The prophets are telling them that you said, ‘You will not experience war or suffer famine. I will give you lasting peace and prosperity in this land.’”
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>Then the Lᴏʀᴅ said to me, “Those prophets are prophesying lies while claiming my authority! I did not send them. I did not commission them. I did not speak to them. They are prophesying to these people false visions, worthless predictions, and the delusions of their own mind.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>“I did not send those prophets, though they claim to be prophesying in my name. They may be saying, ‘No war or famine will happen in this land.’ But I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, say this about them: ‘War and starvation will kill those prophets.’
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>“The people to whom they are prophesying will die through war and famine. Their bodies will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem and there will be no one to bury them. This will happen to the men and their wives, their sons, and their daughters. For I will pour out on them the destruction they deserve.”
## Lament over Present Destruction and Threat of More to Come
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>“Tell these people this, Jeremiah:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>My eyes overflow with tears
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Day and night without ceasing.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For my people, my dear children, have suffered a crushing blow.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They have suffered a serious wound.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>If I go out into the countryside,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I see those who have been killed in battle.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>If I go into the city,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I see those who are sick because of starvation.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For both prophet and priest—
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They go peddling in the land
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>But they are not humbled.’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 19
<span class=verse-first>19</span>Then I said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Lᴏʀᴅ, have you completely rejected the nation of Judah?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do you despise the city of Zion?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why have you struck us with such force
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That we are beyond recovery?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We hope for peace, but nothing good has come of it.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We hope for a time of relief from our troubles, but experience terror.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Lᴏʀᴅ, we confess that we have been wicked.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We confess that our ancestors have done wrong.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We have indeed sinned against you.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the honor of your name, do not treat Jerusalem with contempt.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not treat with disdain the place where your glorious throne sits.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Be mindful of your covenant with us. Do not break it.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do any of the worthless idols of the nations cause rain to fall?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do the skies themselves send showers?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is it not you, O Lᴏʀᴅ our God, who does this?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So we put our hopes in you
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because you alone do all this.”
