## The Words of Agur
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>The words of Agur, the son of Jakeh; an oracle:
>This man says to Ithiel, to Ithiel and to Ukal:
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Surely I am more brutish than any other human being,
>And I do not have human understanding;
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>I have not learned wisdom,
>Nor can I have knowledge of the Holy One.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>Who has ascended into heaven, and then descended?
>Who has gathered up the winds in his fists?
>Who has bound up the waters in his cloak?
>Who has established all the ends of the earth?
>What is his name, and what is his son’s name? Surely you can know!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 5
><span class=verse-first-poetry>5</span>Every word of God is purified;
>He is like a shield for those who take refuge in him.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Do not add to his words,
>Lest he reprove you, and prove you to be a liar.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span>Two things I have asked from you;
>Do not refuse me before I die:
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Remove falsehood and lies far from me;
>Do not give me poverty or riches,
>Feed me with my allotted portion of bread,
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>Lest I become satisfied and act deceptively
>And say, “Who is the Lᴏʀᴅ?”
>Or lest I become poor and steal
>And demean the name of my God.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
><span class=verse-first-poetry>10</span>Do not slander a servant to his master,
>Lest he curse you, and you are found guilty.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
><span class=verse-first-poetry>11</span>There is a generation who curse their fathers
>And do not bless their mothers.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>There is a generation who are pure in their own opinion
>And yet are not washed from their filthiness.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>There is a generation whose eyes are so lofty,
>And whose eyelids are lifted up disdainfully.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>There is a generation whose teeth are like swords
>And whose molars are like knives
>To devour the poor from the earth
>And the needy from among the human race.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
><span class=verse-first-poetry>15</span>The leech has two daughters:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Give! Give!”
>There are three things that will never be satisfied,
>Four that have never said, “Enough”—
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>The grave, the barren womb;
>Earth has not been satisfied with water;
>And fire has never said, “Enough!”
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>The eye that mocks at a father
>And despises obeying a mother—
>The ravens of the valley will peck it out
>And the young vultures will eat it.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
><span class=verse-first-poetry>18</span>There are three things that are too wonderful for me,
>Four that I do not understand:
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>The way of an eagle in the sky,
>The way of a snake on a rock,
>The way of a ship in the sea,
>And the way of a man with a woman.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>This is the way of an adulterous woman:
>She has eaten and wiped her mouth
>And has said, “I have not done wrong.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 21
><span class=verse-first-poetry>21</span>Under three things the earth has trembled,
>And under four things it cannot bear up:
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>Under a servant who becomes king,
>Under a fool who becomes stuffed with food,
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span>Under an unloved woman who becomes married,
>And under a female servant who dispossesses her mistress.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 24
><span class=verse-first-poetry>24</span>There are four things on earth that are small,
>But they are exceedingly wise:
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span>Ants are creatures with little strength,
>But they prepare their food in the summer;
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span>Rock badgers are creatures with little power,
>But they make their homes in the crags;
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span>Locusts have no king,
>But they all go forward by ranks;
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span>A lizard you can catch with the hand,
>But it gets into the palaces of the king.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 29
><span class=verse-first-poetry>29</span>There are three things that are magnificent in their step,
>Four things that move about magnificently:
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span>A lion, mightiest of the beasts,
>Who does not retreat from anything;
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span>A strutting rooster, a male goat,
>And a king with his army around him.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 32
><span class=verse-first-poetry>32</span>If you have done foolishly by exalting yourself
>Or if you have planned evil,
>Put your hand over your mouth!
###### 33
><span class=verse-body-poetry>33</span>For as the churning of milk produces butter
>And as punching the nose produces blood,
>So stirring up anger produces strife.
