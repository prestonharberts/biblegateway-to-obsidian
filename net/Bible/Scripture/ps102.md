###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ, hear my prayer.
>Pay attention to my cry for help.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Do not ignore me in my time of trouble.
>Listen to me.
>When I call out to you, quickly answer me.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>For my days go up in smoke,
>And my bones are charred as in a fireplace.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>My heart is parched and withered like grass,
>For I am unable to eat food.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Because of the anxiety that makes me groan,
>My bones protrude from my skin.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>I am like an owl in the wilderness;
>I am like a screech owl among the ruins.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>I stay awake;
>I am like a solitary bird on a roof.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span>All day long my enemies taunt me;
>Those who mock me use my name in their curses.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>For I eat ashes as if they were bread,
>And mix my drink with my tears,
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Because of your anger and raging fury.
>Indeed, you pick me up and throw me away.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>My days are coming to an end,
>And I am withered like grass.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 12
><span class=verse-first-poetry>12</span>But you, O Lᴏʀᴅ, rule forever,
>And your reputation endures.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>You will rise up and have compassion on Zion.
>For it is time to have mercy on her,
>For the appointed time has come.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>Indeed, your servants take delight in her stones,
>And feel compassion for the dust of her ruins.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>The nations will respect the reputation of the Lᴏʀᴅ,
>And all the kings of the earth will respect his splendor,
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>When the Lᴏʀᴅ rebuilds Zion,
>And reveals his splendor,
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>When he responds to the prayer of the destitute,
>And does not reject their request.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
><span class=verse-first-poetry>18</span>The account of his intervention will be recorded for future generations;
>People yet to be born will praise the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>For he will look down from his sanctuary above;
>From heaven the Lᴏʀᴅ will look toward earth,
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>In order to hear the painful cries of the prisoners,
>And to set free those condemned to die,
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>So they may proclaim the name of the Lᴏʀᴅ in Zion,
>And praise him in Jerusalem,
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>When the nations gather together,
>And the kingdoms pay tribute to the Lᴏʀᴅ.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 23
><span class=verse-first-poetry>23</span>He has taken away my strength in the middle of life;
>He has cut short my days.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span>I say, “O my God, please do not take me away in the middle of my life.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You endure through all generations.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In earlier times you established the earth;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The skies are your handiwork.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will perish,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But you will endure.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will wear out like a garment;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like clothes you will remove them and they will disappear.
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But you remain;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your years do not come to an end.
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The children of your servants will settle down here,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And their descendants will live securely in your presence.”
