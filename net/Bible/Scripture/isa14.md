###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ will certainly have compassion on Jacob; he will again choose Israel as his special people and restore them to their land. Resident foreigners will join them and unite with the family of Jacob.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>Nations will take them and bring them back to their own place. Then the family of Israel will make foreigners their servants as they settle in the Lᴏʀᴅ’s land. They will make their captors captives and rule over the ones who oppressed them.

###### 3
<span class=verse-first>3</span>When the Lᴏʀᴅ gives you relief from your suffering and anxiety and from the hard labor that you were made to perform,

###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ has broken the club of the wicked,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The scepter of rulers.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It furiously struck down nations
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>With unceasing blows.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It angrily ruled over nations,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Oppressing them without restraint.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The whole earth rests and is quiet;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They break into song.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The evergreens also rejoice over your demise,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As do the cedars of Lebanon, singing,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Since you fell asleep,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>No woodsman comes up to chop us down!’
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Sheol below is stirred up about you,

><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You have become just like us!
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Your splendor has been brought down to Sheol,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>As well as the sound of your stringed instruments.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You lie on a bed of maggots,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>With a blanket of worms over you.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Look how you have fallen from the sky,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>O shining one, son of the dawn!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You have been cut down to the ground,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>O conqueror of the nations!
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You said to yourself,

><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Above the stars of El
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will set up my throne.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will rule on the mountain of assembly
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>On the remote slopes of Zaphon.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will climb up to the tops of the clouds;

><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But you were brought down to Sheol,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To the remote slopes of the Pit.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those who see you stare at you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They look at you carefully, thinking:
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Is this the man who shook the earth,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The one who made kingdoms tremble?
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Is this the one who made the world like a wilderness,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Who ruined its cities,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And refused to free his prisoners so they could return home?’
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As for all the kings of the nations,

###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But you have been thrown out of your grave

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Among those headed for the stones of the Pit,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As if you were a mangled corpse.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will not be buried with them,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because you destroyed your land
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And killed your people.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The offspring of the wicked
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will never be mentioned again.

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The burden will be lifted from their shoulders.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>This is the plan I have devised for the whole earth;

###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span>Don’t be so happy, all you Philistines,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Just because the club that beat you has been broken!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For a viper will grow out of the serpent’s root,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And its fruit will be a darting adder.
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The poor will graze in my pastures;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The needy will rest securely.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But I will kill your root by famine;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will put to death all your survivors.
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Wail, O city gate!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Cry out, O city!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Melt with fear, all you Philistines!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For out of the north comes a cloud of smoke,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And there are no stragglers in its ranks.
###### 32
><span class=verse-body-poetry>32</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How will they respond to the messengers of this nation?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, the Lᴏʀᴅ has made Zion secure;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The oppressed among his people will find safety in her.
