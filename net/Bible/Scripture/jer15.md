###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“I will punish them in four different ways: I will have war kill them; I will have dogs drag off their dead bodies; I will have birds and wild beasts devour and destroy their corpses.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“I will make all the people in all the kingdoms of the world horrified at what has happened to them because of what Hezekiah’s son Manasseh, king of Judah, did in Jerusalem.”

###### 5
<span class=verse-first>5</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ cried out,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who in the world will have pity on you, Jerusalem?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who will grieve over you?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who will stop long enough

###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their widows will become in my sight more numerous
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Than the grains of sand on the seashores.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>At noontime I will bring a destroyer
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Against the mothers of their young men.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will cause anguish and terror
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To fall suddenly upon them.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The mother who had seven children will grow faint.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All the breath will go out of her.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Her pride and joy will be taken from her in the prime of their life.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will seem as if the sun had set while it was still day.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>She will suffer shame and humiliation.

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To be killed in war by the onslaughts of their enemies,”
>Says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
