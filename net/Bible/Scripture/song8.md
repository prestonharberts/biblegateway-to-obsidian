## The Beloved’s Wish Song
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Oh, how I wish you were my little brother,
>Nursing at my mother’s breasts;
>If I saw you outside, I could kiss you—
>Surely no one would despise me!
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>I would lead you and bring you to my mother’s house,
>The one who taught me.
>I would give you spiced wine to drink,
>The nectar of my pomegranates.
## Double Refrain: Embracing and Adjuration
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>His left hand is under my head,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

and his right hand embraces me.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span>I admonish you, O maidens of Jerusalem:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not arouse or awaken love until it pleases!”
## The Awakening of Love
###### 5
><span class=verse-first-poetry>5</span>Who is this coming up from the wilderness,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

leaning on her beloved?
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

>Under the apple tree I aroused you;
>There your mother conceived you,
>There she who bore you was in labor of childbirth.
## The Nature of True Love
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Set me like a cylinder seal over your heart,
>Like a signet on your arm.
>For love is as strong as death,
>Passion is as unrelenting as Sheol.
>Its flames burst forth,
>It is a blazing flame.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Surging waters cannot quench love;
>Floodwaters cannot overflow it.
>If someone were to offer all his possessions to buy love,
>The offer would be utterly despised.
## The Brother’s Plan and the Sister’s Reward
###### 8
><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span>We have a little sister,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

and as yet she has no breasts.
What shall we do for our sister
on the day when she is spoken for?
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>If she is a wall,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

we will build on her a battlement of silver;
but if she is a door,
we will barricade her with boards of cedar.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
><span class=verse-first-poetry>10</span>I was a wall,
>And my breasts were like fortress towers.
>Then I found favor in his eyes.
## Solomon’s Vineyard and the Beloved’s Vineyard
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon;
>He leased out the vineyard to those who maintained it.
>Each was to bring 1,000 shekels of silver for its fruit.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>My vineyard, which belongs to me, is at my disposal alone.
>The thousand shekels belong to you, O Solomon,
>And 200 shekels belong to those who maintain it for its fruit.
## Epilogue: The Lover’s Request and His Beloved’s Invitation
###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span>O you who stay in the gardens,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

my companions are listening attentively for your voice;
let me be the one to hear it!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
><span class=verse-first-poetry>14</span>Make haste, my beloved!
>Be like a gazelle or a young stag
>On the mountains of spices.
