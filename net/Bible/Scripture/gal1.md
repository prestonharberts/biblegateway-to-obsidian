## Salutation
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>From Paul, an apostle (not from men, nor by human agency, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead)
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>and all the brothers with me, to the churches of Galatia.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 3
<span class=verse-first>3</span>Grace and peace to you from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from this present evil age according to the will of our God and Father,
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>to whom be glory forever and ever! Amen.
## Occasion of the Letter
###### 6
<span class=verse-first>6</span>I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are following a different gospel—
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>not that there really is another gospel, but there are some who are disturbing you and wanting to distort the gospel of Christ.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>But even if we (or an angel from heaven) should preach a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be condemned to hell!
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>As we have said before, and now I say again, if any one is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, let him be condemned to hell!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>Am I now trying to gain the approval of people, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a slave of Christ!
## Paul’s Vindication of His Apostleship
###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel I preached is not of human origin.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>For I did not receive it or learn it from any human source; instead I received it by a revelation of Jesus Christ.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how I was savagely persecuting the church of God and trying to destroy it.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my nation, and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my ancestors.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>But when the one who set me apart from birth and called me by his grace was pleased
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>to reveal his Son in me so that I could preach him among the Gentiles, I did not go to ask advice from any human being,
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before me, but right away I departed to Arabia, and then returned to Damascus.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and get information from him, and I stayed with him fifteen days.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord’s brother.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>I assure you that, before God, I am not lying about what I am writing to you!
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>Afterward I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>But I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>They were only hearing, “The one who once persecuted us is now proclaiming the good news of the faith he once tried to destroy.”
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>So they glorified God because of me.
