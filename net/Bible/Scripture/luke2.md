## The Census and the Birth of Jesus
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus to register all the empire for taxes.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>This was the first registration, taken when Quirinius was governor of Syria.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>Everyone went to his own town to be registered.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family line of David.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>He went to be registered with Mary, who was promised in marriage to him, and who was expecting a child.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>While they were there, the time came for her to deliver her child.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.
## The Shepherds’ Visit
###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>Now there were shepherds nearby living out in the field, keeping guard over their flock at night.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were absolutely terrified.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid! Listen carefully, for I proclaim to you good news that brings great joy to all the people:
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>“Today your Savior is born in the city of David. He is Christ the Lord.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>“This will be a sign for you: You will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger.”
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>Suddenly a vast, heavenly army appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Glory to God in the highest,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And on earth peace among people with whom he is pleased!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>When the angels left them and went back to heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, that the Lord has made known to us.”
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>So they hurried off and located Mary and Joseph, and found the baby lying in a manger.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>When they saw him, they related what they had been told about this child,
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>and all who heard it were astonished at what the shepherds said.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>But Mary treasured up all these words, pondering in her heart what they might mean.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>So the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen; everything was just as they had been told.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 21
<span class=verse-first>21</span>At the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was named Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
## Jesus’ Presentation at the Temple
###### 22
<span class=verse-first>22</span>Now when the time came for their purification according to the law of Moses, Joseph and Mary brought Jesus up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>(just as it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every firstborn male will be set apart to the Lord”),
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>and to offer a sacrifice according to what is specified in the law of the Lord, a pair of doves or two young pigeons.
## The Prophecy of Simeon
###### 25
<span class=verse-first>25</span>Now there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon who was righteous and devout, looking for the restoration of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>So Simeon, directed by the Spirit, came into the temple courts, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what was customary according to the law,
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>Simeon took him in his arms and blessed God, saying,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Now, according to your word, Sovereign Lord, permit your servant to depart in peace.
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For my eyes have seen your salvation
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That you have prepared in the presence of all peoples:
###### 32
><span class=verse-body-poetry>32</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A light,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For revelation to the Gentiles,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And for glory to your people Israel.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 33
<span class=verse-first>33</span>So the child’s father and mother were amazed at what was said about him.
###### 34
<span class=verse-body>34</span>Then Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary, “Listen carefully: This child is destined to be the cause of the falling and rising of many in Israel and to be a sign that will be rejected.
###### 35
<span class=verse-body>35</span>“Indeed, as a result of him the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed—and a sword will pierce your own soul as well!”
## The Testimony of Anna
###### 36
<span class=verse-first>36</span>There was also a prophetess, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old, having been married to her husband for seven years until his death.
###### 37
<span class=verse-body>37</span>She had lived as a widow since then for eighty-four years. She never left the temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day.
###### 38
<span class=verse-body>38</span>At that moment, she came up to them and began to give thanks to God and to speak about the child to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 39
<span class=verse-first>39</span>So when Joseph and Mary had performed everything according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth.
###### 40
<span class=verse-body>40</span>And the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom, and the favor of God was upon him.
## Jesus in the Temple
###### 41
<span class=verse-first>41</span>Now Jesus’ parents went to Jerusalem every year for the Feast of the Passover.
###### 42
<span class=verse-body>42</span>When he was twelve years old, they went up according to custom.
###### 43
<span class=verse-body>43</span>But when the feast was over, as they were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it,
###### 44
<span class=verse-body>44</span>but (because they assumed that he was in their group of travelers) they went a day’s journey. Then they began to look for him among their relatives and acquaintances.
###### 45
<span class=verse-body>45</span>When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem to look for him.
###### 46
<span class=verse-body>46</span>After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.
###### 47
<span class=verse-body>47</span>And all who heard Jesus were astonished at his understanding and his answers.
###### 48
<span class=verse-body>48</span>When his parents saw him, they were overwhelmed. His mother said to him, “Child, why have you treated us like this? Look, your father and I have been looking for you anxiously.”
###### 49
<span class=verse-body>49</span>But he replied, “Why were you looking for me? Didn’t you know that I must be in my Father’s house?”
###### 50
<span class=verse-body>50</span>Yet his parents did not understand the remark he made to them.
###### 51
<span class=verse-body>51</span>Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them. But his mother kept all these things in her heart.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 52
<span class=verse-first>52</span>And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favor with God and with people.
