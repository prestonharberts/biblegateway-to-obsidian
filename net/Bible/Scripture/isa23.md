## The Lord Will Judge Tyre
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>This is an oracle about Tyre:
>Wail, you large ships,
>For the port is too devastated to enter!
>From the land of Cyprus this news is announced to them.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Lament, you residents of the coast,
>You merchants of Sidon who travel over the sea,
>Whose agents sail over
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>The deep waters.
>Grain from the Shihor region,
>Crops grown near the Nile she receives;
>She is the trade center of the nations.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>Be ashamed, O Sidon,
>For the sea says this, O fortress of the sea:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have not gone into labor
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or given birth;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have not raised young men
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or brought up young women.”
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>When the news reaches Egypt,
>They will be shaken by what has happened to Tyre.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Travel to Tarshish!
>Wail, you residents of the coast!
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Is this really your boisterous city
>Whose origins are in the distant past,
>And whose feet led her to a distant land to reside?
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span>Who planned this for royal Tyre,
>Whose merchants are princes,
>Whose traders are the dignitaries of the earth?
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies planned it—
>To dishonor the pride that comes from all her beauty,
>To humiliate all the dignitaries of the earth.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Daughter Tarshish, travel back to your land, as one crosses the Nile;
>There is no longer any marketplace in Tyre.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ stretched out his hand over the sea,
>He shook kingdoms;
>He gave the order
>To destroy Canaan’s fortresses.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 12
><span class=verse-first-poetry>12</span>He said,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will no longer celebrate,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Oppressed virgin daughter Sidon!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Get up, travel to Cyprus,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But you will find no relief there.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span>Look at the land of the Chaldeans,
>These people who have lost their identity!
>The Assyrians have made it a home for wild animals.
>They erected their siege towers,
>Demolished its fortresses,
>And turned it into a heap of ruins.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>Wail, you large ships,
>For your fortress is destroyed!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>At that time Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, the typical life span of a king. At the end of seventy years Tyre will try to attract attention again, like the prostitute in the popular song:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Take the harp,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Go through the city,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Forgotten prostitute!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Play it well,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Play lots of songs,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So you’ll be noticed.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>At the end of seventy years the Lᴏʀᴅ will revive Tyre. She will start making money again by selling her services to all the earth’s kingdoms.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>Her profits and earnings will be set apart for the Lᴏʀᴅ. They will not be stored up or accumulated, for her profits will be given to those who live in the Lᴏʀᴅ’s presence and will be used to purchase large quantities of food and beautiful clothes.
