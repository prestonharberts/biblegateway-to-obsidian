###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is it to God that a strong man is of benefit?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is it to him that even a wise man is profitable?
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is it of any special benefit to the Almighty
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That you should be righteous,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or is it any gain to him
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That you make your ways blameless?
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is it because of your piety that he rebukes you
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And goes to judgment with you?
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is not your wickedness great
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And is there no end to your iniquity?
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For you took pledges from your brothers
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For no reason,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And you stripped the clothing from the naked.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You gave the weary no water to drink
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And from the hungry you withheld food.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Although you were a powerful man, owning land,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>An honored man living on it,
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You sent widows away empty-handed,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the arms of the orphans you crushed.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That is why snares surround you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And why sudden fear terrifies you,
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why it is so dark you cannot see,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And why a flood of water covers you.

###### 12
><span class=verse-first-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is not God on high in heaven?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And see the lofty stars, how high they are!
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But you have said, ‘What does God know?
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Does he judge through such deep darkness?
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Thick clouds are a veil for him, so he does not see us,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>As he goes back and forth
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>In the vault of heaven.’
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will you keep to the old path
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That evil men have walked—
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Men who were carried off before their time,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When the flood was poured out
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>On their foundations?
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They were saying to God, ‘Turn away from us,’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And, ‘What can the Almighty do to us?’
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But it was he who filled their houses
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>With good things—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yet the counsel of the wicked
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Was far from me.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The righteous see their destruction and rejoice;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The innocent mock them scornfully, saying,
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Surely our enemies are destroyed,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And fire consumes their wealth.’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 21
><span class=verse-first-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Reconcile yourself with God,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And be at peace with him;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In this way your prosperity will be good.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Accept instruction from his mouth
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And store up his words in your heart.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If you remove wicked behavior far from your tent,
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And throw your gold in the dust—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your gold of Ophir
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Among the rocks in the ravines—
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then the Almighty himself will be your gold,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the choicest silver for you.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Surely then you will delight yourself in the Almighty,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And will lift up your face toward God.
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will pray to him and he will hear you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And you will fulfill your vows to him.
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Whatever you decide on a matter,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will be established for you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And light will shine on your ways.
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When people are brought low and you say,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Lift them up!’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then he will save the downcast;
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will deliver even someone who is not innocent,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who will escape through the cleanness of your hands.”
