## The Lord Will Judge Edom
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Come near, you nations, and listen!
>Pay attention, you people!
>The earth and everything it contains must listen,
>The world and everything that lives in it.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ is angry at all the nations
>And furious with all their armies.
>He will annihilate them and slaughter them.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Their slain will be left unburied,
>Their corpses will stink;
>The hills will soak up their blood.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>All the stars in the sky will fade away,
>The sky will roll up like a scroll;
>All its stars will wither,
>Like a leaf withers and falls from a vine
>Or a fig withers and falls from a tree.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>He says, “Indeed, my sword has slaughtered heavenly powers.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, it now descends on Edom,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>On the people I will annihilate in judgment.”
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ’s sword is dripping with blood,
>It is covered with fat;
>It drips with the blood of young rams and goats
>And is covered with the fat of rams’ kidneys.
>For the Lᴏʀᴅ is holding a sacrifice in Bozrah,
>A bloody slaughter in the land of Edom.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Wild oxen will be slaughtered along with them,
>As well as strong bulls.
>Their land is drenched with blood,
>Their soil is covered with fat.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ has planned a day of revenge,
>A time when he will repay Edom for her hostility toward Zion.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>Edom’s streams will be turned into pitch
>And her soil into brimstone;
>Her land will become burning pitch.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Night and day it will burn;
>Its smoke will ascend continually.
>Generation after generation it will be a wasteland,
>And no one will ever pass through it again.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Owls and wild animals will live there,
>All kinds of wild birds will settle in it.
>The Lᴏʀᴅ will stretch out over her
>The measuring line of ruin
>And the plumb line of destruction.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Her nobles will have nothing left to call a kingdom,
>And all her officials will disappear.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>Her fortresses will be overgrown with thorns;
>Thickets and weeds will grow in her fortified cities.
>Jackals will settle there;
>Ostriches will live there.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>Wild animals and wild dogs will congregate there;
>Wild goats will bleat to one another.
>Yes, nocturnal animals will rest there
>And make for themselves a nest.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>Owls will make nests and lay eggs there;
>They will hatch them and protect them.
>Yes, hawks will gather there,
>Each with its mate.

###### 16
><span class=verse-first-poetry>16</span>Carefully read the scroll of the Lᴏʀᴅ!
>Not one of these creatures will be missing,
>None will lack a mate.
>For the Lᴏʀᴅ has issued the decree,
>And his own spirit gathers them.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>He assigns them their allotment;
>He measures out their assigned place.
>They will live there permanently;
>They will settle in it through successive generations.
