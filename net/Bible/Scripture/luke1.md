## Explanatory Preface
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Now many have undertaken to compile an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us,
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>like the accounts passed on to us by those who were eyewitnesses and servants of the word from the beginning.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>So it seemed good to me as well, because I have followed all things carefully from the beginning, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>so that you may know for certain the things you were taught.
## Birth Announcement of John the Baptist
###### 5
<span class=verse-first>5</span>During the reign of Herod king of Judea, there lived a priest named Zechariah who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah, and he had a wife named Elizabeth, who was a descendant of Aaron.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>They were both righteous in the sight of God, following all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blamelessly.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>But they did not have a child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both very old.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>Now while Zechariah was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty,
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to enter the Holy Place of the Lord and burn incense.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>Now the whole crowd of people were praying outside at the hour of the incense offering.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>An angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense, appeared to him.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>And Zechariah, visibly shaken when he saw the angel, was seized with fear.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son; you will name him John.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>“Joy and gladness will come to you, and many will rejoice at his birth,
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>“for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He must never drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even before his birth.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>“He will turn many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>“And he will go as forerunner before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers back to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span>Zechariah said to the angel, “How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is old as well.”
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>The angel answered him, “I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>“And now, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time, you will be silent, unable to speak, until the day these things take place.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 21
<span class=verse-first>21</span>Now the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they began to wonder why he was delayed in the Holy Place.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>When he came out, he was not able to speak to them. They realized that he had seen a vision in the Holy Place, because he was making signs to them and remained unable to speak.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>When his time of service was over, he went to his home.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 24
<span class=verse-first>24</span>After some time his wife Elizabeth became pregnant, and for five months she kept herself in seclusion. She said,
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>“This is what the Lord has done for me at the time when he has been gracious to me, to take away my disgrace among people.”
## Birth Announcement of Jesus the Messiah
###### 26
<span class=verse-first>26</span>In the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town of Galilee called Nazareth,
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, a descendant of David, and the virgin’s name was Mary.
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>The angel came to her and said, “Greetings, favored one, the Lord is with you!”
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>But she was greatly troubled by his words and began to wonder about the meaning of this greeting.
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>So the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God!
###### 31
<span class=verse-body>31</span>“Listen: You will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus.
###### 32
<span class=verse-body>32</span>“He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.
###### 33
<span class=verse-body>33</span>“He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and his kingdom will never end.”
###### 34
<span class=verse-body>34</span>Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I have not been intimate with a man?”
###### 35
<span class=verse-body>35</span>The angel replied, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore the child to be born will be holy; he will be called the Son of God.
###### 36
<span class=verse-body>36</span>“And look, your relative Elizabeth has also become pregnant with a son in her old age—although she was called barren, she is now in her sixth month!
###### 37
<span class=verse-body>37</span>“For nothing will be impossible with God.”
###### 38
<span class=verse-body>38</span>So Mary said, “Yes, I am a servant of the Lord; let this happen to me according to your word.” Then the angel departed from her.
## Mary and Elizabeth
###### 39
<span class=verse-first>39</span>In those days Mary got up and went hurriedly into the hill country, to a town of Judah,
###### 40
<span class=verse-body>40</span>and entered Zechariah’s house and greeted Elizabeth.
###### 41
<span class=verse-body>41</span>When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
###### 42
<span class=verse-body>42</span>She exclaimed with a loud voice, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child in your womb!
###### 43
<span class=verse-body>43</span>“And who am I that the mother of my Lord should come and visit me?
###### 44
<span class=verse-body>44</span>“For the instant the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.
###### 45
<span class=verse-body>45</span>“And blessed is she who believed that what was spoken to her by the Lord would be fulfilled.”
## Mary’s Hymn of Praise
###### 46
<span class=verse-first>46</span>And Mary said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My soul exalts the Lord,
###### 47
><span class=verse-body-poetry>47</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And my spirit has begun to rejoice in God my Savior,
###### 48
><span class=verse-body-poetry>48</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because he has looked upon the humble state of his servant.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For from now on all generations will call me blessed,
###### 49
><span class=verse-body-poetry>49</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name;
###### 50
><span class=verse-body-poetry>50</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>From generation to generation he is merciful to those who fear him.
###### 51
><span class=verse-body-poetry>51</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He has demonstrated power with his arm; he has scattered those whose pride wells up from the sheer arrogance of their hearts.
###### 52
><span class=verse-body-poetry>52</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He has brought down the mighty from their thrones, and has lifted up those of lowly position;
###### 53
><span class=verse-body-poetry>53</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He has filled the hungry with good things, and has sent the rich away empty.
###### 54
><span class=verse-body-poetry>54</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He has helped his servant Israel, remembering his mercy,
###### 55
><span class=verse-body-poetry>55</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As he promised to our ancestors, to Abraham and to his descendants forever.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 56
<span class=verse-first>56</span>So Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and then returned to her home.
## The Birth of John
###### 57
<span class=verse-first>57</span>Now the time came for Elizabeth to have her baby, and she gave birth to a son.
###### 58
<span class=verse-body>58</span>Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 59
<span class=verse-first>59</span>On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they wanted to name him Zechariah after his father.
###### 60
<span class=verse-body>60</span>But his mother replied, “No! He must be named John.”
###### 61
<span class=verse-body>61</span>They said to her, “But none of your relatives bears this name.”
###### 62
<span class=verse-body>62</span>So they made signs to the baby’s father, inquiring what he wanted to name his son.
###### 63
<span class=verse-body>63</span>He asked for a writing tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” And they were all amazed.
###### 64
<span class=verse-body>64</span>Immediately Zechariah’s mouth was opened and his tongue released, and he spoke, blessing God.
###### 65
<span class=verse-body>65</span>All their neighbors were filled with fear, and throughout the entire hill country of Judea all these things were talked about.
###### 66
<span class=verse-body>66</span>All who heard these things kept them in their hearts, saying, “What then will this child be?” For the Lord’s hand was indeed with him.
## Zechariah’s Praise and Prediction
###### 67
<span class=verse-first>67</span>Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 68
><span class=verse-body-poetry>68</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because he has come to help and has redeemed his people.
###### 69
><span class=verse-body-poetry>69</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For he has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David,
###### 70
><span class=verse-body-poetry>70</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from long ago,
###### 71
><span class=verse-body-poetry>71</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That we should be saved from our enemies,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And from the hand of all who hate us.
###### 72
><span class=verse-body-poetry>72</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He has done this to show mercy to our ancestors,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And to remember his holy covenant—
###### 73
><span class=verse-body-poetry>73</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The oath that he swore to our ancestor Abraham.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>This oath grants
###### 74
><span class=verse-body-poetry>74</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That we, being rescued from the hand of our enemies,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>May serve him without fear,
###### 75
><span class=verse-body-poetry>75</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In holiness and righteousness before him for as long as we live.
###### 76
><span class=verse-body-poetry>76</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,
###### 77
><span class=verse-body-poetry>77</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To give his people knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins.
###### 78
><span class=verse-body-poetry>78</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because of our God’s tender mercy
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The dawn will break upon us from on high
###### 79
><span class=verse-body-poetry>79</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To guide our feet into the way of peace.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 80
<span class=verse-first>80</span>And the child kept growing and becoming strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day he was revealed to Israel.
