## Reiteration of the Call to Obedience
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>You must love the Lᴏʀᴅ your God and do what he requires; keep his statutes, ordinances, and commandments at all times.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>Bear in mind today that I am not speaking to your children who have not personally experienced the judgments of the Lᴏʀᴅ your God, which revealed his greatness, strength, and power.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>They did not see the awesome deeds he performed in the midst of Egypt against Pharaoh king of Egypt and his whole land,
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>or what he did to the army of Egypt, including their horses and chariots, when he made the waters of the Red Sea overwhelm them while they were pursuing you and he annihilated them.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>They did not see what he did to you in the wilderness before you reached this place,
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>or what he did to Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab the Reubenite, when the earth opened its mouth in the middle of the Israelite camp and swallowed them, their families, their tents, and all the property they brought with them.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>I am speaking to you because you are the ones who saw with your own eyes all the great deeds of the Lᴏʀᴅ.
## The Abundance of the Land of Promise
###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>Now pay attention to all the commandments I am giving you today, so that you may be strong enough to enter and possess the land where you are headed,
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>and that you may enjoy long life in the land the Lᴏʀᴅ promised to give to your ancestors and their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>For the land where you are headed is not like the land of Egypt from which you came, a land where you planted seed and which you irrigated by hand like a vegetable garden.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>Instead, the land you are crossing the Jordan to occupy is one of hills and valleys, a land that drinks in water from the rains,
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>a land the Lᴏʀᴅ your God looks after. He is constantly attentive to it from the beginning to the end of the year.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>Now, if you pay close attention to my commandments that I am giving you today and love the Lᴏʀᴅ your God and serve him with all your mind and being,
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>then he promises, “I will send rain for your land in its season, the autumn and the spring rains, so that you may gather in your grain, new wine, and olive oil.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>“I will provide pasture for your livestock and you will eat your fill.”
## Exhortation to Instruction and Obedience
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>Make sure you do not turn away to serve and worship other gods!
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>Then the anger of the Lᴏʀᴅ will erupt against you, and he will close up the sky so that it does not rain. The land will not yield its produce, and you will soon be removed from the good land that the Lᴏʀᴅ is about to give you.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span>Fix these words of mine into your mind and being, tie them as a reminder on your hands, and let them be symbols on your forehead.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>Teach them to your children and speak of them as you sit in your house, as you walk along the road, as you lie down, and as you get up.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>Inscribe them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>so that your days and those of your descendants may be extended in the land that the Lᴏʀᴅ promised to give to your ancestors, like the days of heaven itself.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>For if you carefully observe all of these commandments I am giving you and love the Lᴏʀᴅ your God, live according to his standards, and remain loyal to him,
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>then he will drive out all these nations ahead of you, and you will dispossess nations greater and stronger than you.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>Every place you set your foot will be yours; your border will extend from the desert to Lebanon and from the River (that is, the Euphrates) as far as the Mediterranean Sea.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>Nobody will be able to resist you; the Lᴏʀᴅ your God will spread the fear and terror of you over the whole land on which you walk, just as he promised you.
## Anticipation of a Blessing and Cursing Ceremony
###### 26
<span class=verse-first>26</span>Take note—I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse:
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>the blessing if you take to heart the commandments of the Lᴏʀᴅ your God that I am giving you today,
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>and the curse if you pay no attention to his commandments and turn from the way I am setting before you today to pursue other gods you have not known.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 29
<span class=verse-first>29</span>When the Lᴏʀᴅ your God brings you into the land you are to possess, you must pronounce the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>Are they not across the Jordan River, toward the west, in the land of the Canaanites who live in the rift valley opposite Gilgal near the oak of Moreh?
###### 31
<span class=verse-body>31</span>For you are about to cross the Jordan to possess the land the Lᴏʀᴅ your God is giving you, and you will possess and inhabit it.
###### 32
<span class=verse-body>32</span>Be certain to keep all the statutes and ordinances that I am presenting to you today.
