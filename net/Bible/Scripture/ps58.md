###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Do you rulers really pronounce just decisions?
>Do you judge people fairly?
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>No! You plan how to do what is unjust;
>You deal out violence in the earth.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>The wicked turn aside from birth;
>Liars go astray as soon as they are born.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>Their venom is like that of a snake,
>Like a deaf serpent that does not hear,
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>That does not respond to the magicians,
>Or to a skilled snake charmer.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 6
><span class=verse-first-poetry>6</span>O God, break the teeth in their mouths!
>Smash the jawbones of the lions, O Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Let them disappear like water that flows away.
>Let them wither like grass.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Let them be like a snail that melts away as it moves along.
>Let them be like stillborn babies that never see the sun.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>Before the kindling is even placed under your pots,
>He will sweep it away along with both the raw and cooked meat.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
><span class=verse-first-poetry>10</span>The godly will rejoice when they see vengeance carried out;
>They will bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Then observers will say,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yes indeed, the godly are rewarded.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yes indeed, there is a God who judges in the earth.”
