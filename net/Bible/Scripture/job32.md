## V. The Speeches of Elihu [32:
## 1-37:
## 24]
## Elihu’s First Speech
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>So these three men refused to answer Job further, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>Then Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry. He was angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>With Job’s three friends he was also angry, because they could not find an answer, and so declared Job guilty.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>Now Elihu had waited before speaking to Job, because the others were older than he was.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>But when Elihu saw that the three men had no further reply, he became very angry.
## Elihu Claims Wisdom
###### 6
<span class=verse-first>6</span>So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite spoke up:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I am young, but you are elderly;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That is why I was fearful,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And afraid to explain to you what I know.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I said to myself, ‘Age should speak,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And length of years should make wisdom known.’
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But it is a spirit in people,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The breath of the Almighty,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That makes them understand.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It is not the aged who are wise,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Nor old men who understand what is right.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I, even I, will explain what I know.’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
><span class=verse-first-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, I waited for you to speak;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I listened closely to your wise thoughts, while you were searching for words.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Now I was paying you close attention,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yet there was no one proving Job wrong,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Not one of you was answering his statements.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So do not say, ‘We have found wisdom.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>God will refute him, not man.’
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Job has not directed his words to me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And so I will not reply to him with your arguments.”
## Job’s Friends Failed to Answer
###### 15
><span class=verse-first-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are dismayed and cannot answer anymore;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They have nothing left to say.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I have waited. But because they do not speak,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because they stand there and answer no more,
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I too will answer my part,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I too will explain what I know.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I am full of words,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the spirit within me constrains me.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Inside I am like wine that has no outlet,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like new wineskins ready to burst!
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will speak, so that I may find relief;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will open my lips, so that I may answer.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will not show partiality to any person,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Nor will I confer a title on anyone.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I do not know how to give honorary titles,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If I did, my Creator would quickly do away with me.
