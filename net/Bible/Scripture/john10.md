## Jesus as the Good Shepherd
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>“I tell you the solemn truth, the one who does not enter the sheepfold by the door, but climbs in some other way, is a thief and a robber.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“The one who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“The doorkeeper opens the door for him, and the sheep hear his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“When he has brought all his own sheep out, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they recognize his voice.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“They will never follow a stranger, but will run away from him, because they do not recognize the stranger’s voice.”
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>Jesus told them this parable, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
<span class=verse-first>7</span>So Jesus said again, “I tell you the solemn truth, I am the door for the sheep.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>“All who came before me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>“I am the door. If anyone enters through me, he will be saved, and will come in and go out, and find pasture.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come so that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>“The hired hand, who is not a shepherd and does not own sheep, sees the wolf coming and abandons the sheep and runs away. So the wolf attacks the sheep and scatters them.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>“Because he is a hired hand and is not concerned about the sheep, he runs away.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>“I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me—
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>“just as the Father knows me and I know the Father—and I lay down my life for the sheep.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>“I have other sheep that do not come from this sheepfold. I must bring them too, and they will listen to my voice, so that there will be one flock and one shepherd.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>“This is why the Father loves me—because I lay down my life, so that I may take it back again.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>“No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down of my own free will. I have the authority to lay it down, and I have the authority to take it back again. This commandment I received from my Father.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 19
<span class=verse-first>19</span>Another sharp division took place among the Jewish people because of these words.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>Many of them were saying, “He is possessed by a demon and has lost his mind! Why do you listen to him?”
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>Others said, “These are not the words of someone possessed by a demon. A demon cannot cause the blind to see, can it?”
## Jesus at the Feast of Dedication
###### 22
<span class=verse-first>22</span>Then came the feast of the Dedication in Jerusalem.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple area in Solomon’s Portico.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>The Jewish leaders surrounded him and asked, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.”
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>Jesus replied, “I told you and you do not believe. The deeds I do in my Father’s name testify about me.
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>“But you refuse to believe because you are not my sheep.
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>“My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>“I give them eternal life, and they will never perish; no one will snatch them from my hand.
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>“My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them from my Father’s hand.
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>“The Father and I are one.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 31
<span class=verse-first>31</span>The Jewish leaders picked up rocks again to stone him to death.
###### 32
<span class=verse-body>32</span>Jesus said to them, “I have shown you many good deeds from the Father. For which one of them are you going to stone me?”
###### 33
<span class=verse-body>33</span>The Jewish leaders replied, “We are not going to stone you for a good deed but for blasphemy, because you, a man, are claiming to be God.”
###### 34
<span class=verse-body>34</span>Jesus answered, “Is it not written in your law, ‘I said, you are gods’?
###### 35
<span class=verse-body>35</span>“If those people to whom the word of God came were called ‘gods’ (and the scripture cannot be broken),
###### 36
<span class=verse-body>36</span>‘do you say about the one whom the Father set apart and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?
###### 37
<span class=verse-body>37</span>“If I do not perform the deeds of my Father, do not believe me.
###### 38
<span class=verse-body>38</span>“But if I do them, even if you do not believe me, believe the deeds, so that you may come to know and understand that I am in the Father and the Father is in me.”
###### 39
<span class=verse-body>39</span>Then they attempted again to seize him, but he escaped their clutches.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 40
<span class=verse-first>40</span>Jesus went back across the Jordan River again to the place where John had been baptizing at an earlier time, and he stayed there.
###### 41
<span class=verse-body>41</span>Many came to him and began to say, “John performed no miraculous sign, but everything John said about this man was true!”
###### 42
<span class=verse-body>42</span>And many believed in Jesus there.
