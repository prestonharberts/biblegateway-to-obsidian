## The Lord Demands Justice, not Ritual
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Listen to what the Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Get up! Defend yourself before the mountains.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Present your case before the hills.”
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Hear the Lᴏʀᴅ’s accusation, you mountains,
>You enduring foundations of the earth.
>For the Lᴏʀᴅ has a case against his people;
>He has a dispute with Israel!
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My people, how have I wronged you?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How have I wearied you? Answer me!
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In fact, I brought you up from the land of Egypt;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I delivered you from that place of slavery.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to lead you.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My people, recall how King Balak of Moab planned to harm you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How Balaam son of Beor responded to him.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Recall how you journeyed from Shittim to Gilgal,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So you might acknowledge that the Lᴏʀᴅ has treated you fairly.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 6
><span class=verse-first-poetry>6</span>With what should I enter the Lᴏʀᴅ’s presence?
>With what should I bow before the sovereign God?
>Should I enter his presence with burnt offerings,
>With year-old calves?
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Will the Lᴏʀᴅ accept a thousand rams
>Or ten thousand streams of olive oil?
>Should I give him my firstborn child as payment for my rebellion,
>My offspring—my own flesh and blood—for my sin?
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>He has told you, O man, what is good,
>And what the Lᴏʀᴅ really wants from you:
>He wants you to carry out justice, to love faithfulness,
>And to live obediently before your God.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span>Listen! The Lᴏʀᴅ is calling to the city!
>It is wise to respect your authority, O Lᴏʀᴅ.
>Listen, O nation, and those assembled in the city!
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will not overlook, O sinful house, the dishonest gain you have hoarded away
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or the smaller-than-standard measure I hate so much.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I do not condone the use of rigged scales,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or a bag of deceptive weights.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The city’s wealthy people readily resort to violence;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Her inhabitants tell lies;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their tongues speak deceptive words.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will strike you brutally
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And destroy you because of your sin.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will eat, but not be satisfied.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even if you have the strength to overtake some prey,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will not be able to carry it away;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If you do happen to carry away something,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will deliver it over to the sword.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will plant crops, but will not harvest them;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will squeeze oil from the olives, but you will have no oil to rub on your bodies;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will squeeze juice from the grapes, but you will have no wine to drink.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You follow Omri’s edicts
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And all the practices of Ahab’s dynasty;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You follow their policies.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Therefore I will make you an appalling sight;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The city’s inhabitants will be taunted derisively,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And nations will mock all of you.”
