><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Seizing dwelling places that do not belong to them.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are frightening and terrifying;

## Habakkuk Voices Some Concerns
###### 12
><span class=verse-first-poetry>12</span>Lᴏʀᴅ, you have been active from ancient times;
>My sovereign God, you are immortal.
>Lᴏʀᴅ, you have made them your instrument of judgment.
>Protector, you have appointed them as your instrument of punishment.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>You are too just to tolerate evil;
>You are unable to condone wrongdoing.
>So why do you put up with such treacherous people?
>Why do you say nothing when the wicked devour those more righteous than they are?
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>You made people like fish in the sea,
>Like animals in the sea that have no ruler.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>The Babylonian tyrant pulls them all up with a fishhook;
>He hauls them in with his throw net.
>When he catches them in his dragnet,
>He is very happy.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>Because of his success he offers sacrifices to his throw net
>And burns incense to his dragnet;
>For because of them he has plenty of food,
>And more than enough to eat.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>Will he then continue to fill and empty his throw net?
>Will he always destroy nations and spare none?
