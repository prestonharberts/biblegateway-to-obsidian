###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>So get rid of all evil and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>And yearn like newborn infants for pure, spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up to salvation,
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>if you have experienced the Lord’s kindness.
## A Living Stone, a Chosen People
###### 4
<span class=verse-first>4</span>So as you come to him, a living stone rejected by men but chosen and precious in God’s sight,
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>you yourselves, as living stones, are built up as a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood and to offer spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>For it says in scripture, “Look, I lay in Zion a stone, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and whoever believes in him will never be put to shame.”
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>So you who believe see his value, but for those who do not believe, the stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>and a stumbling-stone and a rock to trip over. They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
<span class=verse-first>9</span>But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people of his own, so that you may proclaim the virtues of the one who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>You once were not a people, but now you are God’s people. You were shown no mercy, but now you have received mercy.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>Dear friends, I urge you as foreigners and exiles to keep away from fleshly desires that do battle against the soul,
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>and maintain good conduct among the non-Christians, so that though they now malign you as wrongdoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God when he appears.
## Submission to Authorities
###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>Be subject to every human institution for the Lord’s sake, whether to a king as supreme
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>or to governors as those he commissions to punish wrongdoers and praise those who do good.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>For God wants you to silence the ignorance of foolish people by doing good.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>Live as free people, not using your freedom as a pretext for evil, but as God’s slaves.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>Honor all people, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the king.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span>Slaves, be subject to your masters with all reverence, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are perverse.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>For this finds God’s favor, if because of conscience toward God someone endures hardships in suffering unjustly.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>For what credit is it if you sin and are mistreated and endure it? But if you do good and suffer and so endure, this finds favor with God.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>For to this you were called, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving an example for you to follow in his steps.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>He committed no sin nor was deceit found in his mouth.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>When he was maligned, he did not answer back; when he suffered, he threatened no retaliation, but committed himself to God who judges justly.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we may cease from sinning and live for righteousness. By his wounds you were healed.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>For you were going astray like sheep but now you have turned back to the shepherd and guardian of your souls.
