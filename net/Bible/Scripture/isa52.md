###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Wake up! Wake up!
>Clothe yourself with strength, O Zion!
>Put on your beautiful clothes,
>O Jerusalem, holy city.

###### 3
<span class=verse-first>3</span>For this is what the Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You were sold for nothing,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And you will not be redeemed for money.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>For this is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In the beginning my people went to live temporarily in Egypt;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Assyria oppressed them for no good reason.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And now, what do we have here?” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed my people have been carried away for nothing,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those who rule over them taunt,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And my name is constantly slandered all day long.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For this reason my people will know my name;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For this reason they will know at that time that I am the one who says,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Here I am.’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span>How delightful it is to see approaching over the mountains
>The feet of a messenger who announces peace,
>A messenger who brings good news, who announces deliverance,
>Who says to Zion, “Your God reigns!”
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Listen, your watchmen shout;
>In unison they shout for joy,
>For they see with their very own eyes
>The Lᴏʀᴅ’s return to Zion.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>In unison give a joyful shout,
>O ruins of Jerusalem!
>For the Lᴏʀᴅ consoles his people;
>He protects Jerusalem.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ reveals his royal power
>In the sight of all the nations;
>The entire earth sees
>Our God deliver.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
><span class=verse-first-poetry>11</span>Leave! Leave! Get out of there!
>Don’t touch anything unclean!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Get out of it!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Stay pure, you who carry the Lᴏʀᴅ’s holy items.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yet do not depart quickly
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or leave in a panic.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ goes before you;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The God of Israel is your rear guard.”
## The Lord Will Vindicate His Servant
###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, my servant will succeed!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will be elevated, lifted high, and greatly exalted—
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>(just as many were horrified by the sight of you)
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He was so disfigured he no longer looked like a man;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His form was so marred he no longer looked human—
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So now he will startle many nations.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Kings will be shocked by his exaltation,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For they will witness something unannounced to them,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And they will understand something they had not heard about.
