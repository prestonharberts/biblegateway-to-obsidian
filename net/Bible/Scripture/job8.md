><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For inquire now of the former generation,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And pay attention to the findings

###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For we were born yesterday and do not have knowledge,

###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>While they are still beginning to flower
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And not ripe for cutting,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They can wither away
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Faster than any grass.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Such is the destiny of all who forget God;

###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Whose trust is in something futile,
