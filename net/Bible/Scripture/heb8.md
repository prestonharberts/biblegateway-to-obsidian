## The High Priest of a Better Covenant
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Now the main point of what we are saying is this: We have such a high priest, one who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>a minister in the sanctuary and the true tabernacle that the Lord, not man, set up.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. So this one too had to have something to offer.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest, since there are already priests who offer the gifts prescribed by the law.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>The place where they serve is a sketch and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary, just as Moses was warned by God as he was about to complete the tabernacle. For he says, “See that you make everything according to the design shown to you on the mountain.”
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>But now Jesus has obtained a superior ministry, since the covenant that he mediates is also better and is enacted on better promises.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>For if that first covenant had been faultless, no one would have looked for a second one.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>But showing its fault, God says to them,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will complete a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will not be like the covenant that I made with their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they did not continue in my covenant and I had no regard for them, says the Lord.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For this is the covenant that I will establish with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their minds and I will inscribe them on their hearts. And I will be their God and they will be my people.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And there will be no need at all for each one to teach his countryman or each one to teach his brother saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ since they will all know me, from the least to the greatest.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I will be merciful toward their evil deeds, and their sins I will remember no longer.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>When he speaks of a new covenant, he makes the first obsolete. Now what is growing obsolete and aging is about to disappear.
