###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span> I wish that my head were a well full of water
>And my eyes were a fountain full of tears!
>If they were, I could cry day and night
>For those of my dear people who have been killed.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span> I wish I had a lodging place in the wilderness
>Where I could spend some time like a weary traveler.
>Then I would desert my people
>And walk away from them
>Because they are all unfaithful to God,
>A congregation of people that has been disloyal to him.”
## The Lord Laments That He Has No Choice But to Judge Them
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ says,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>These people are like soldiers who have readied their bows.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their tongues are always ready to shoot out lies.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They have become powerful in the land,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But they have not done so by honest means.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, they do one evil thing after another
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And do not pay attention to me.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Everyone must be on his guard around his friends.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He must not even trust any of his relatives.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For every one of them will find some way to cheat him.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And all his friends will tell lies about him.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>One friend deceives another
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And no one tells the truth.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>These people have trained themselves to tell lies.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They do wrong and are unable to repent.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They do one act of violence after another,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And one deceitful thing after another.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They refuse to pay attention to me,”
>Says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
<span class=verse-first>7</span>Therefore the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will now purify them in the fires of affliction and test them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The wickedness of my dear people has left me no choice.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>What else can I do?
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their tongues are like deadly arrows.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are always telling lies.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Friendly words for their neighbors come from their mouths,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But their minds are thinking up ways to trap them.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will certainly punish them for doing such things!” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will certainly bring retribution on such a nation as this!”
## The Coming Destruction Calls For Mourning
###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>I said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will weep and mourn for the grasslands on the mountains;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will sing a mournful song for the pastures in the wilderness
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because they are so scorched no one travels through them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The sound of livestock is no longer heard there.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even the birds in the sky and the wild animals in the fields
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Have fled and are gone.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Jackals will make their home there.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will destroy the towns of Judah
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So that no one will be able to live in them.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 12
<span class=verse-first>12</span>I said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who is wise enough to understand why this has happened?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who has a word from the Lᴏʀᴅ that can explain it?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why does the land lie in ruins?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why is it as scorched as a desert through which no one travels?”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ answered, “This has happened because these people have rejected my laws that I gave them. They have not obeyed me or followed those laws.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>“Instead they have followed the stubborn inclinations of their own hearts. They have paid allegiance to the gods called Baal, as their fathers taught them to do.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>“So then, listen to what I, the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, say, ‘I will make these people eat the bitter food of suffering and drink the poison water of judgment.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>‘I will scatter them among nations that neither they nor their ancestors have known anything about. I will send people chasing after them with swords until I have destroyed them.’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
<span class=verse-first>17</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies told me to say to this people:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Take note of what I say.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Call for the women who mourn for the dead!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Summon those who are the most skilled at it!”
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>I said, “Indeed, let them come quickly and sing a song of mourning for us.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let them wail loudly until tears stream from our own eyes
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And our eyelids overflow with water.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the sound of wailing is soon to be heard in Zion,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>We are utterly ruined! We are completely disgraced!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For we have left our land,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For our houses have been torn down!’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>I said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So now, you wailing women, listen to the Lord’s message.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Open your ears to the message from his mouth.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Teach your daughters this mournful song,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And let every woman teach her neighbor this lament.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Death has climbed in through our windows.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>It has entered into our fortified houses.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>It has taken away our children who play in the streets.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>It has taken away our young men who gather in the city squares.’
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Tell your daughters and neighbors, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ says:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The dead bodies of people will lie scattered everywhere
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like manure scattered on a field.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will lie scattered on the ground
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like grain that has been cut down but has not been gathered.”’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 23
<span class=verse-first>23</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ says,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Wise people should not boast that they are wise.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Powerful people should not boast that they are powerful.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Rich people should not boast that they are rich.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If people want to boast, they should boast about this:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They should boast that they understand and know me.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They should boast that they know and understand
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, act out of faithfulness, fairness, and justice in the earth
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And that I desire people to do these things,”
>Says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 25
<span class=verse-first>25</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ says, “Watch out! The time is soon coming when I will punish all those who are circumcised only in the flesh.
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>“That is, I will punish the Egyptians, the Judeans, the Edomites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, and all the desert people who cut their hair short at the temples. I will do so because none of the people of those nations are really circumcised in the Lᴏʀᴅ’s sight. Moreover, none of the people of Israel are circumcised when it comes to their hearts.”
