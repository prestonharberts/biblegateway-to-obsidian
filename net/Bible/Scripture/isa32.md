## Justice and Wisdom Will Prevail
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Look, a king will promote fairness;
>Officials will promote justice.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Each of them will be like a shelter from the wind
>And a refuge from a rainstorm;
>Like streams of water in a dry region
>And like the shade of a large cliff in a parched land.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Eyes will no longer be blind
>And ears will be attentive.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>The mind that acts rashly will possess discernment,
>And the tongue that stutters will speak with ease and clarity.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>A fool will no longer be called honorable;
>A deceiver will no longer be called principled.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>For a fool speaks disgraceful things;
>His mind plans out sinful deeds.
>He commits godless deeds
>And says misleading things about the Lᴏʀᴅ;
>He gives the hungry nothing to satisfy their appetite
>And gives the thirsty nothing to drink.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>A deceiver’s methods are evil;
>He dreams up evil plans
>To ruin the poor with lies,
>Even when the needy are in the right.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>An honorable man makes honorable plans;
>His honorable character gives him security.
## The Lord Will Give True Security
###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span>You complacent women,
>Get up and listen to me!
>You carefree daughters,
>Pay attention to what I say!
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>In a year’s time
>You carefree ones will shake with fear,
>For the grape harvest will fail,
>And the fruit harvest will not arrive.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Tremble, you complacent ones!
>Shake with fear, you carefree ones!
>Strip off your clothes and expose yourselves—
>Put sackcloth around your waists.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Mourn over the field,
>Over the delightful fields
>And the fruitful vine.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>Mourn over the land of my people,
>Which is overgrown with thorns and briers,
>And over all the once-happy houses
>In the city filled with revelry.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>For the fortress is neglected;
>The once-crowded city is abandoned.
>Hill and watchtower
>Are permanently uninhabited.
>Wild donkeys love to go there,
>And flocks graze there.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>This desolation will continue until new life is poured out on us from heaven.
>Then the wilderness will become an orchard
>And the orchard will be considered a forest.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>Justice will settle down in the wilderness
>And fairness will live in the orchard.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>Fairness will produce peace
>And result in lasting security.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>My people will live in peaceful settlements,
>In secure homes,
>And in safe, quiet places.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>Even if the forest is destroyed
>And the city is annihilated,
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>You will be blessed,
>You who plant seed by all the banks of the streams,
>You who let your ox and donkey graze.
