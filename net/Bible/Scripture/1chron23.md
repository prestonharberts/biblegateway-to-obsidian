## David Organizes the Levites

###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>David said, “Of these, 24,000 are to direct the work of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple; 6,000 are to be officials and judges;
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“4,000 are to be gatekeepers; and 4,000 are to praise the Lᴏʀᴅ with the instruments I supplied for worship.”
