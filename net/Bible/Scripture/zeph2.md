## The Prophet Warns the People
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Bunch yourselves together like straw, you undesirable nation,
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Before God’s decree becomes reality and the day of opportunity disappears like windblown chaff,
>Before the Lᴏʀᴅ’s raging anger overtakes you—
>Before the day of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s angry judgment overtakes you!
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Seek the Lᴏʀᴅ’s favor, all you humble people of the land who have obeyed his commands!
>Strive to do what is right! Strive to be humble!
>Maybe you will be protected on the day of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s angry judgment.
## Judgment on Surrounding Nations
###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span>Indeed, Gaza will be deserted
>And Ashkelon will become a heap of ruins.
>Invaders will drive away the people of Ashdod by noon,
>And Ekron will be overthrown.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Beware, you who live by the sea, the people who came from Crete.

###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>The seacoast will be used as pasture lands by the shepherds
>And as pens for their flocks.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Those who are left from the kingdom of Judah will take possession of it.
>By the sea they will graze,
>In the houses of Ashkelon they will lie down in the evening,
>For the Lᴏʀᴅ their God will intervene for them and restore their prosperity.

###### 8
><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have heard Moab’s taunts
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the Ammonites’ insults.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They taunted my people
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And verbally harassed those living in Judah.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Therefore, as surely as I live,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Be certain that Moab will become like Sodom
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the Ammonites like Gomorrah.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will be overrun by weeds,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Filled with salt pits,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And permanently desolate.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those of my people who are left will plunder their belongings;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those who are left in Judah will take possession of their land.”
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>This is how they will be repaid for their arrogance,
>For they taunted and verbally harassed the people of the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ will terrify them,
>For he will weaken all the gods of the earth.
>All the distant nations will worship the Lᴏʀᴅ in their own lands.

###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ will attack the north
>And destroy Assyria.
>He will make Nineveh a heap of ruins;
>It will be as barren as the desert.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>Flocks and herds will lie down in the middle of it,
>As well as every kind of wild animal.
>Owls will sleep in the tops of its support pillars;
>They will hoot through the windows.
>Rubble will cover the thresholds;
>Even the cedar work will be exposed to the elements.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>This is how the once-proud city will end up—
>The city that was so secure.
>She thought to herself, “I am unique! No one can compare to me!”
>What a heap of ruins she has become, a place where wild animals live!
>Everyone who passes by her taunts her and shakes his fist.
