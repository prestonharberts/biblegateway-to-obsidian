## Samson’s Birth
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Israelites again did evil in the Lᴏʀᴅ’s sight, so the Lᴏʀᴅ handed them over to the Philistines for forty years.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 2
<span class=verse-first>2</span>There was a man named Manoah from Zorah, from the Danite tribe. His wife was infertile and childless.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>The angel of the Lᴏʀᴅ appeared to the woman and said to her, “You are infertile and childless, but you will conceive and have a son.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“Now be careful! Do not drink wine or beer, and do not eat any food that will make you ritually unclean.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“Look, you will conceive and have a son. You must never cut his hair, for the child will be dedicated to God from birth. He will begin to deliver Israel from the power of the Philistines.”
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>The woman went and said to her husband, “A man sent from God came to me! He looked like God’s angel—he was very awesome. I did not ask him where he came from, and he did not tell me his name.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“He said to me, ‘Look, you will conceive and have a son. So now, do not drink wine or beer and do not eat any food that will make you ritually unclean. For the child will be dedicated to God from birth till the day he dies.’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>Manoah prayed to the Lᴏʀᴅ, “Please, Lord, allow the man sent from God to visit us again, so he can teach us how we should raise the child who will be born.”
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>God answered Manoah’s prayer. God’s angel visited the woman again while she was sitting in the field. But her husband Manoah was not with her.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>The woman ran at once and told her husband, “Come quickly, the man who visited me the other day has appeared to me!”
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>So Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he met the man, he said to him, “Are you the man who spoke to my wife?” He said, “Yes.”
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>Manoah said, “Now, when your announcement comes true, how should the child be raised and what should he do?”
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>The angel of the Lᴏʀᴅ told Manoah, “Your wife should pay attention to everything I told her.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>“She should not drink anything that the grapevine produces. She must not drink wine or beer, and she must not eat any food that will make her ritually unclean. She should obey everything I commanded her to do.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>Manoah said to the angel of the Lᴏʀᴅ, “Please stay here awhile, so we can prepare a young goat for you to eat.”
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>The angel of the Lᴏʀᴅ said to Manoah, “If I stay, I will not eat your food. But if you want to make a burnt sacrifice to the Lᴏʀᴅ, you should offer it.” (He said this because Manoah did not know that he was the angel of the Lᴏʀᴅ.)
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>Manoah said to the angel of the Lᴏʀᴅ, “Tell us your name, so we can honor you when your announcement comes true.”
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>The angel of the Lᴏʀᴅ said to him, “You should not ask me my name, because you cannot comprehend it.”
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>Manoah took a young goat and a grain offering and offered them on a rock to the Lᴏʀᴅ. The Lᴏʀᴅ’s messenger did an amazing thing as Manoah and his wife watched.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>As the flame went up from the altar toward the sky, the angel of the Lᴏʀᴅ went up in it while Manoah and his wife watched. They fell facedown to the ground.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 21
<span class=verse-first>21</span>The angel of the Lᴏʀᴅ did not appear again to Manoah and his wife. After all this happened Manoah realized that the visitor had been the angel of the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>Manoah said to his wife, “We will certainly die, because we have seen a supernatural being!”
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>But his wife said to him, “If the Lᴏʀᴅ wanted to kill us, he would not have accepted the burnt offering and the grain offering from us. He would not have shown us all these things, or have spoken to us like this just now.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 24
<span class=verse-first>24</span>Manoah’s wife gave birth to a son and named him Samson. The child grew and the Lᴏʀᴅ empowered him.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ’s Spirit began to control him in Mahaneh Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.
