## Ignorance of the Future Demands Diligence in the Present
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Send your grain overseas,
>For after many days you will get a return.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Divide your merchandise among seven or even eight investments,
>For you do not know what calamity may happen on earth.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>If the clouds are full of rain, they will empty themselves on the earth,
>And whether a tree falls to the south or to the north, the tree will lie wherever it falls.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>He who watches the wind will not sow,
>And he who observes the clouds will not reap.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Just as you do not know the path of the wind,
>Or how the bones form in the womb of a pregnant woman,
>So you do not know the work of God who makes everything.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 6
><span class=verse-first-poetry>6</span>Sow your seed in the morning,
>And do not stop working until the evening;
>For you do not know which activity will succeed—
>Whether this one or that one, or whether both will prosper equally.
## Life Should Be Enjoyed Because Death is Inevitable
###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span>Light is sweet,
>And it is pleasant for a person to see the sun.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>So, if a man lives many years, let him rejoice in them all,
>But let him remember that the days of darkness will be many—all that is about to come is obscure.
## Enjoy Life to the Fullest under the Fear of God
###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span>Rejoice, young man, while you are young,
>And let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth.
>Follow the impulses of your heart and the desires of your eyes,
>But know that God will judge your motives and actions.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Banish emotional stress from your mind.
>And put away pain from your body;
>For youth and the prime of life are fleeting.
