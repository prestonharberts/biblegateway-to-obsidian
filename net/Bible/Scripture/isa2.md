###### 2
><span class=verse-first-poetry>2</span>In future days
>The mountain of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple will endure
>As the most important of mountains,
>And will be the most prominent of hills.
>All the nations will stream to it;
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Many peoples will come and say,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Come, let us go up to the Lᴏʀᴅ’s mountain,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To the temple of the God of Jacob,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So he can teach us his requirements,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And we can follow his standards.”
>For Zion will be the center for moral instruction;
>The Lᴏʀᴅ’s message will issue from Jerusalem.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>He will judge disputes between nations;
>He will settle cases for many peoples.
>They will beat their swords into plowshares,
>And their spears into pruning hooks.
>Nations will not take up the sword against other nations,
>And they will no longer train for war.

###### 5

>Come, let us walk in the Lᴏʀᴅ’s guiding light.
## The Lord’s Day of Judgment
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Indeed, O Lᴏʀᴅ, you have abandoned your people,
>The descendants of Jacob.
>For diviners from the east are everywhere;
>They consult omen readers like the Philistines do.
>Plenty of foreigners are around.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Their land is full of gold and silver;
>There is no end to their wealth.
>Their land is full of horses;
>There is no end to their chariots.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Their land is full of worthless idols;
>They worship the product of their own hands,
>What their own fingers have fashioned.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>Men bow down to them in homage,
>They lie flat on the ground in worship.
>Don’t spare them!
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Go up into the rocky cliffs,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Hide in the ground.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Get away from the dreadful judgment of the Lᴏʀᴅ,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>From his royal splendor!
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Proud men will be brought low,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Arrogant men will be humiliated;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ alone will be exalted
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In that day.

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For all who are proud—they will be humiliated;
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For all the cedars of Lebanon,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That are so high and mighty,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For all the oaks of Bashan;
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For all the tall mountains,
