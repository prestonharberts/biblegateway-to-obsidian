###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>Early in the morning he came to the temple courts again. All the people came to him, and he sat down and began to teach them.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>The experts in the law and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught committing adultery. They made her stand in front of them
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>and said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of adultery.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“In the law Moses commanded us to stone to death such women. What then do you say?”
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>(Now they were asking this in an attempt to trap him, so that they could bring charges against him.) Jesus bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>When they persisted in asking him, he stood up straight and replied, “Whoever among you is guiltless may be the first to throw a stone at her.”
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>Then he bent over again and wrote on the ground.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>Now when they heard this, they began to drift away one at a time, starting with the older ones, until Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>Jesus stood up straight and said to her, “Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?”
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>She replied, “No one, Lord.” And Jesus said, “I do not condemn you either. Go, and from now on do not sin any more.”\]\]
## Jesus as the Light of the World
###### 12
<span class=verse-first>12</span>Then Jesus spoke out again, “I am the light of the world! The one who follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>So the Pharisees objected, “You testify about yourself; your testimony is not true!”
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>Jesus answered, “Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is true, because I know where I came from and where I am going. But you people do not know where I came from or where I am going.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>“You people judge by outward appearances; I do not judge anyone.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>“But if I judge, my evaluation is accurate, because I am not alone when I judge, but I and the Father who sent me do so together.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>“It is written in your law that the testimony of two men is true.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>“I testify about myself and the Father who sent me testifies about me.”
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>Then they began asking him, “Who is your father?” Jesus answered, “You do not know either me or my Father. If you knew me you would know my Father too.”
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>(Jesus spoke these words near the offering box while he was teaching in the temple courts. No one seized him because his time had not yet come.)
## Where Jesus Came From and Where He is Going
###### 21
<span class=verse-first>21</span>Then Jesus said to them again, “I am going away, and you will look for me but will die in your sin. Where I am going you cannot come.”
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>So the Jewish leaders began to say, “Perhaps he is going to kill himself, because he says, ‘Where I am going you cannot come.’”
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>Jesus replied, “You people are from below; I am from above. You people are from this world; I am not from this world.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>“Thus I told you that you will die in your sins. For unless you believe that I am he, you will die in your sins.”
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>So they said to him, “Who are you?” Jesus replied, “What I have told you from the beginning.
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>“I have many things to say and to judge about you, but the Father who sent me is truthful, and the things I have heard from him I speak to the world.”
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>(They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father.)
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>Then Jesus said, “When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and I do nothing on my own initiative, but I speak just what the Father taught me.
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>“And the one who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, because I always do those things that please him.”
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>While he was saying these things, many people believed in him.
## Abraham’s Children and the Devil’s Children
###### 31
<span class=verse-first>31</span>Then Jesus said to those Judeans who had believed him, “If you continue to follow my teaching, you are really my disciples
###### 32
<span class=verse-body>32</span>“and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”
###### 33
<span class=verse-body>33</span>“We are descendants of Abraham,” they replied, “and have never been anyone’s slaves! How can you say, ‘You will become free’?”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 34
<span class=verse-first>34</span>Jesus answered them, “I tell you the solemn truth, everyone who practices sin is a slave of sin.
###### 35
<span class=verse-body>35</span>“The slave does not remain in the family forever, but the son remains forever.
###### 36
<span class=verse-body>36</span>“So if the son sets you free, you will be really free.
###### 37
<span class=verse-body>37</span>“I know that you are Abraham’s descendants. But you want to kill me, because my teaching makes no progress among you.
###### 38
<span class=verse-body>38</span>“I am telling you the things I have seen while with the Father; as for you, practice the things you have heard from the Father!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 39
<span class=verse-first>39</span>They answered him, “Abraham is our father!” Jesus replied, “If you are Abraham’s children, you would be doing the deeds of Abraham.
###### 40
<span class=verse-body>40</span>“But now you are trying to kill me, a man who has told you the truth I heard from God. Abraham did not do this!
###### 41
<span class=verse-body>41</span>You people are doing the deeds of your father.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

Then they said to Jesus, “We were not born as a result of immorality! We have only one Father, God himself.”
###### 42
<span class=verse-body>42</span>Jesus replied, “If God were your Father, you would love me, for I have come from God and am now here. I have not come on my own initiative, but he sent me.
###### 43
<span class=verse-body>43</span>“Why don’t you understand what I am saying? It is because you cannot accept my teaching.
###### 44
<span class=verse-body>44</span>“You people are from your father the devil, and you want to do what your father desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not uphold the truth, because there is no truth in him. Whenever he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, because he is a liar and the father of lies.
###### 45
<span class=verse-body>45</span>“But because I am telling you the truth, you do not believe me.
###### 46
<span class=verse-body>46</span>“Who among you can prove me guilty of any sin? If I am telling you the truth, why don’t you believe me?
###### 47
<span class=verse-body>47</span>“The one who belongs to God listens and responds to God’s words. You don’t listen and respond, because you don’t belong to God.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 48
<span class=verse-first>48</span>The Judeans replied, “Aren’t we correct in saying that you are a Samaritan and are possessed by a demon?”
###### 49
<span class=verse-body>49</span>Jesus answered, “I am not possessed by a demon, but I honor my Father—and yet you dishonor me.
###### 50
<span class=verse-body>50</span>“I am not trying to get praise for myself. There is one who demands it, and he also judges.
###### 51
<span class=verse-body>51</span>“I tell you the solemn truth, if anyone obeys my teaching, he will never see death.”
###### 52
<span class=verse-body>52</span>Then the Judeans responded, “Now we know you’re possessed by a demon! Both Abraham and the prophets died, and yet you say, ‘If anyone obeys my teaching, he will never experience death.’
###### 53
<span class=verse-body>53</span>“You aren’t greater than our father Abraham who died, are you? And the prophets died too! Who do you claim to be?”
###### 54
<span class=verse-body>54</span>Jesus replied, “If I glorify myself, my glory is worthless. The one who glorifies me is my Father, about whom you people say, ‘He is our God.’
###### 55
<span class=verse-body>55</span>“Yet you do not know him, but I know him. If I were to say that I do not know him, I would be a liar like you. But I do know him, and I obey his teaching.
###### 56
<span class=verse-body>56</span>“Your father Abraham was overjoyed to see my day, and he saw it and was glad.”
###### 57
<span class=verse-body>57</span>Then the Judeans replied, “You are not yet fifty years old! Have you seen Abraham?”
###### 58
<span class=verse-body>58</span>Jesus said to them, “I tell you the solemn truth, before Abraham came into existence, I am!”
###### 59
<span class=verse-body>59</span>Then they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus was hidden from them and went out from the temple area.
