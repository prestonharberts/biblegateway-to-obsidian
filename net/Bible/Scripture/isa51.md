## There is Hope for the Future
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Listen to me, you who pursue godliness,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who seek the Lᴏʀᴅ.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look at the rock from which you were chiseled,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>At the quarry from which you were dug.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look at Abraham, your father,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And Sarah, who gave you birth.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When I summoned him, he was a lone individual,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But I blessed him and gave him numerous descendants.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Certainly the Lᴏʀᴅ will console Zion;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will console all her ruins.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will make her wilderness like Eden,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Her arid rift valley like the garden of the Lᴏʀᴅ.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Happiness and joy will be restored to her,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Thanksgiving and the sound of music.

###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Pay attention to me, my people.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Listen to me, my people!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I will issue a decree,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will make my justice a light to the nations.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I am ready to vindicate,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I am ready to deliver,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will establish justice among the nations.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The coastlands wait patiently for me;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They wait in anticipation for the revelation of my power.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look up at the sky.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look at the earth below.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the sky will dissipate like smoke,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the earth will wear out like clothes;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Its residents will die like gnats.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But the deliverance I give is permanent;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The vindication I provide will not disappear.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Listen to me, you who know what is right,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You people who are aware of my law.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Don’t be afraid of the insults of men;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Don’t be discouraged because of their abuse.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For a moth will eat away at them like clothes;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A clothes moth will devour them like wool.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But the vindication I provide will be permanent;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The deliverance I give will last.”

###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span>Wake up! Wake up!
>Clothe yourself with strength, O arm of the Lᴏʀᴅ!
>Wake up as in former times, as in antiquity.
>Did you not smash the Proud One?
>Did you not wound the sea monster?
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Did you not dry up the sea,
>The waters of the great deep?
>Did you not make a path through the depths of the sea,
>So those delivered from bondage could cross over?
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Those whom the Lᴏʀᴅ has ransomed will return;
>They will enter Zion with a happy shout.
>Unending joy will crown them,
>Happiness and joy will overwhelm them;
>Grief and suffering will disappear.

###### 12
><span class=verse-first-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I, I am the one who consoles you.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why are you afraid of mortal men,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Of mere human beings who are as short-lived as grass?
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why do you forget the Lᴏʀᴅ, who made you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who stretched out the sky
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And founded the earth?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why do you constantly tremble all day long
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>At the anger of the oppressor,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When he makes plans to destroy?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Where is the anger of the oppressor?
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The one who suffers will soon be released;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will not die in prison,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will not go hungry.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I am the Lᴏʀᴅ your God,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who churns up the sea so that its waves surge.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies is his name!”
## Zion’s Time to Celebrate
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I commission you as my spokesman;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I cover you with the palm of my hand,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To establish the sky and to found the earth,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To say to Zion, ‘You are my people.’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
><span class=verse-first-poetry>17</span>Wake up! Wake up!
>Get up, O Jerusalem!
>You drank from the cup the Lᴏʀᴅ passed to you,
>Which was full of his anger.
>You drained dry
>The goblet full of intoxicating wine.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>There was no one to lead her
>Among all the children she bore;
>There was no one to take her by the hand
>Among all the children she raised.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>These double disasters confronted you.
>But who feels sorry for you?
>Destruction and devastation,
>Famine and sword.
>But who consoles you?
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>Your children faint;
>They lie at the head of every street
>Like an antelope in a snare.
>They are left in a stupor by the Lᴏʀᴅ’s anger,
>By the battle cry of your God.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 21
><span class=verse-first-poetry>21</span>So listen to this, oppressed one,
>Who is drunk, but not from wine.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>This is what your Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ, even your God who judges his people says:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, I have removed from your hand
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The cup of intoxicating wine,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The goblet full of my anger.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will no longer have to drink it.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will put it into the hand of your tormentors
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who said to you, ‘Lie down, so we can walk over you.’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You made your back like the ground,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And like the street for those who walked over you.”
