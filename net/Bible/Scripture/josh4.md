## Israel Commemorates the Crossing
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>When the entire nation was on the other side, the Lᴏʀᴅ told Joshua,
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“Select for yourselves twelve men from the people, one per tribe.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“Instruct them, ‘Pick up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, from the very place where the priests stand firmly, and carry them over with you and put them in the place where you camp tonight.’”
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>Joshua summoned the twelve men he had appointed from the Israelites, one per tribe.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>Joshua told them, “Go in front of the ark of the Lᴏʀᴅ your God to the middle of the Jordan. Each of you is to put a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the Israelite tribes.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>“The stones will be a reminder to you. When your children ask someday, ‘Why are these stones important to you?’
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“tell them how the water of the Jordan stopped flowing before the ark of the covenant of the Lᴏʀᴅ. When it crossed the Jordan, the water of the Jordan stopped flowing. These stones will be a lasting memorial for the Israelites.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>The Israelites did just as Joshua commanded. They picked up twelve stones, according to the number of the Israelite tribes, from the middle of the Jordan as the Lᴏʀᴅ had instructed Joshua. They carried them over with them to the camp and put them there.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>Joshua also set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan in the very place where the priests carrying the ark of the covenant stood. They remain there to this very day.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>Now the priests carrying the ark of the covenant were standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything the Lord had commanded Joshua to tell the people was accomplished, in accordance with all that Moses had commanded Joshua. The people went across quickly,
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>and when all the people had finished crossing, the ark of the Lᴏʀᴅ and the priests crossed as the people looked on.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed for battle ahead of the Israelites, just as Moses had instructed them.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>About 40,000 battle-ready troops marched past the Lᴏʀᴅ to fight on the rift valley plains of Jericho.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
<span class=verse-first>14</span>That day the Lᴏʀᴅ brought honor to Joshua before all Israel. They respected him all his life, just as they had respected Moses.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ told Joshua,
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>“Instruct the priests carrying the ark of the covenantal laws to come up from the Jordan.”
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>So Joshua instructed the priests, “Come up from the Jordan!”
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>The priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the Lᴏʀᴅ came up from the middle of the Jordan, and as soon as they set foot on dry land, the water of the Jordan flowed again and returned to flood stage.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 19
<span class=verse-first>19</span>The people went up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month and camped in Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>Now Joshua set up in Gilgal the twelve stones they had taken from the Jordan.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>He told the Israelites, “When your children someday ask their fathers, ‘What do these stones represent?’
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>“explain to your children, ‘Israel crossed the Jordan River on dry ground.’
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>“For the Lᴏʀᴅ your God dried up the water of the Jordan before you while you crossed over. It was just like when the Lᴏʀᴅ your God dried up the Red Sea before us while we crossed it.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>“He has done this so all the nations of the earth might recognize the Lᴏʀᴅ’s power and so you might always obey the Lᴏʀᴅ your God.”
