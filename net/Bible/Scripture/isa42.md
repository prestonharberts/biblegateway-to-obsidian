><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My chosen one in whom I take pleasure.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have placed my Spirit on him;

###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will not cry out or shout;

###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A crushed reed he will not break,

###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will not grow dim or be crushed

###### 5
><span class=verse-first-poetry>5</span>This is what the true God, the Lᴏʀᴅ, says—
>The one who created the sky and stretched it out,
>The one who fashioned the earth and everything that lives on it,
>The one who gives breath to the people on it,
>And life to those who live on it:
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, officially commission you;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I take hold of your hand.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I protect you and make you a covenant mediator for people,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And a light to the nations,
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To open blind eyes,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To release prisoners from dungeons,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those who live in darkness from prisons.”
## The Lord Intervenes
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I am the Lᴏʀᴅ! That is my name!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will not share my glory with anyone else,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or the praise due me with idols.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, my earlier predictive oracles have come to pass;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Now I announce new events.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Before they begin to occur,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I reveal them to you.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
><span class=verse-first-poetry>10</span>Sing to the Lᴏʀᴅ a brand new song!
>Praise him from the horizon of the earth,
>You who go down to the sea, and everything that lives in it,
>You coastlands and those who live there.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Let the wilderness and its cities shout out,
>The towns where the nomads of Kedar live.
>Let the residents of Sela shout joyfully;
>Let them shout loudly from the mountaintops.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Let them give the Lᴏʀᴅ the honor he deserves;
>Let them praise his deeds in the coastlands.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ emerges like a hero,
>Like a warrior he inspires himself for battle;
>He shouts, yes, he yells,
>He shows his enemies his power.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
><span class=verse-first-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have been inactive for a long time;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I kept quiet and held back.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a woman in labor I groan;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I pant and gasp.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will make the trees on the mountains and hills wither up;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will dry up all their vegetation.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will turn streams into islands,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And dry up pools of water.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will lead the blind along an unfamiliar way;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will guide them down paths they have never traveled.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will turn the darkness in front of them into light,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And level out the rough ground.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>This is what I will do for them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will not abandon them.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those who trust in idols
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will turn back and be utterly humiliated,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those who say to metal images, ‘You are our gods.’”
## The Lord Reasons with His People
###### 18
><span class=verse-first-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Listen, you deaf ones!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Take notice, you blind ones!
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My servant is truly blind,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My messenger is truly deaf.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My covenant partner, the servant of the Lᴏʀᴅ, is truly blind.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You see many things, but don’t comprehend;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their ears are open, but do not hear.”
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ wanted to exhibit his justice
>By magnifying his law and displaying it.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>But these people are looted and plundered;
>All of them are trapped in pits
>And held captive in prisons.
>They were carried away as loot with no one to rescue them;
>They were carried away as plunder, and no one says, “Bring that back!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 23
><span class=verse-first-poetry>23</span>Who among you will pay attention to this?
>Who will listen attentively in the future?
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span>Who handed Jacob over to the robber?
>Who handed Israel over to the looters?
>Was it not the Lᴏʀᴅ, against whom we sinned?
>They refused to follow his commands;
>They disobeyed his law.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span>So he poured out his fierce anger on them,
>Along with the devastation of war.
>Its flames encircled them, but they did not realize it;
>It burned against them, but they did not take it to heart.
