## The Lord Takes Delight in Zion
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>For the sake of Zion I will not be silent;
>For the sake of Jerusalem I will not be quiet,
>Until her vindication shines brightly
>And her deliverance burns like a torch.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Nations will see your vindication,
>And all kings your splendor.
>You will be called by a new name
>That the Lᴏʀᴅ himself will give you.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>You will be a majestic crown in the hand of the Lᴏʀᴅ,
>A royal turban in the hand of your God.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>You will no longer be called, “Abandoned,”
>And your land will no longer be called “Desolate.”
>Indeed, you will be called “My Delight is in Her,”
>And your land “Married.”
>For the Lᴏʀᴅ will take delight in you,
>And your land will be married to him.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>As a young man marries a young woman,
>So your sons will marry you.
>As a bridegroom rejoices over a bride,
>So your God will rejoice over you.

###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Don’t allow him to rest until he reestablishes Jerusalem,

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will never again give your grain
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To your enemies as food,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And foreigners will not drink your wine,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Which you worked hard to produce.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But those who harvest the grain will eat it,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And will praise the Lᴏʀᴅ.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those who pick the grapes will drink the wine
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In the courts of my holy sanctuary.”
