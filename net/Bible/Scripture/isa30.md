## Egypt Will Prove Unreliable
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The rebellious children are as good as dead,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those who make plans without consulting me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who form alliances without consulting my Spirit,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And thereby compound their sin.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They travel down to Egypt
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Without seeking my will,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Seeking Pharaoh’s protection,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And looking for safety in Egypt’s protective shade.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But Pharaoh’s protection will bring you nothing but shame,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the safety of Egypt’s protective shade nothing but humiliation.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Though his officials are in Zoan
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And his messengers arrive at Hanes,
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All will be put to shame
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because of a nation that cannot help them,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who cannot give them aid or help,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But only shame and disgrace.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 6
><span class=verse-first-poetry>6</span>This is an oracle about the animals in the Negev:
>Through a land of distress and danger,
>Inhabited by lionesses and roaring lions,
>By snakes and darting adders,
>They transport their wealth on the backs of donkeys,
>Their riches on the humps of camels,
>To a nation that cannot help them.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Egypt is totally incapable of helping.
>For this reason I call her
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Proud one who is silenced.”
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Now go, write it down on a tablet in their presence,
>Inscribe it on a scroll,
>So that it might be preserved for a future time
>As an enduring witness.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>For these are rebellious people—
>They are lying children,
>Children unwilling to obey the Lᴏʀᴅ’s law.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>They say to the visionaries, “See no more visions!”
>And to the seers, “Don’t relate messages to us about what is right!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Tell us nice things;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Relate deceptive messages.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Turn aside from the way;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Stray off the path.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Remove from our presence the Holy One of Israel.”
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>For this reason this is what the Holy One of Israel says:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You have rejected this message;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You trust instead in your ability to oppress and trick,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And rely on that kind of behavior.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So this sin will become your downfall.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will be like a high wall
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That bulges and cracks and is ready to collapse;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It crumbles suddenly, in a flash.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It shatters in pieces like a clay jar,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So shattered to bits that none of it can be salvaged.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Among its fragments one cannot find a shard large enough
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To scoop a hot coal from a fire
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or to skim off water from a cistern.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>For this is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ, the Holy One of Israel says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If you repented and patiently waited for me, you would be delivered;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If you calmly trusted in me, you would find strength,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But you are unwilling.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You say, ‘No, we will flee on horses,’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So you will indeed flee.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You say, ‘We will ride on fast horses,’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So your pursuers will be fast.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>One thousand will scurry at the battle cry of one enemy soldier;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>At the battle cry of five enemy soldiers you will all run away,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Until the remaining few are as isolated
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As a flagpole on a mountaintop
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or a signal flag on a hill.”
## The Lord Will Not Abandon His People
###### 18
><span class=verse-first-poetry>18</span>For this reason the Lᴏʀᴅ is ready to show you mercy;
>He sits on his throne, ready to have compassion on you.
>Indeed, the Lᴏʀᴅ is a just God;
>All who wait for him in faith will be blessed.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 19
><span class=verse-first-poetry>19</span>For people will live in Zion;
>In Jerusalem you will weep no more.
>When he hears your cry of despair, he will indeed show you mercy;
>When he hears it, he will respond to you.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>The Lord will give you distress to eat
>And suffering to drink;
>But your teachers will no longer be hidden;
>Your eyes will see them.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>You will hear a word spoken behind you, saying,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>This is the correct way, walk in it,”
>Whether you are heading to the right or the left.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>You will desecrate your silver-plated idols
>And your gold-plated images.
>You will throw them away as if they were a menstrual rag,
>Saying to them, “Get out!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 23
><span class=verse-first-poetry>23</span>He will water the seed you plant in the ground,
>And the ground will produce crops in abundance.
>At that time your cattle will graze in wide pastures.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span>The oxen and donkeys used in plowing
>Will eat seasoned feed winnowed with a shovel and pitchfork.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span>On every high mountain
>And every high hill
>There will be streams flowing with water,
>At the time of great slaughter when the fortified towers collapse.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span>The light of the full moon will be like the sun’s glare,
>And the sun’s glare will be seven times brighter,
>Like the light of seven days,
>When the Lᴏʀᴅ binds up his people’s fractured bones
>And heals their severe wound.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 27
><span class=verse-first-poetry>27</span>Look, the name of the Lᴏʀᴅ comes from a distant place
>In raging anger and awesome splendor.
>He speaks angrily,
>And his word is like destructive fire.
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span>His battle cry overwhelms like a flooding river
>That reaches one’s neck.
>He shakes the nations in a sieve that isolates the chaff;
>He puts a bit into the mouth of the nations and leads them to destruction.
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span>You will sing
>As you do in the evening when you are celebrating a festival.
>You will be happy like one who plays a flute
>As he goes to the mountain of the Lᴏʀᴅ, the Rock who shelters Israel.
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ will give a mighty shout
>And intervene in power,
>With furious anger and flaming, destructive fire,
>With a driving rainstorm and hailstones.
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span>Indeed, the Lᴏʀᴅ’s shout will shatter Assyria;
>He will beat them with a club.
###### 32
><span class=verse-body-poetry>32</span>Every blow from his punishing cudgel
>With which the Lᴏʀᴅ will beat them
>Will be accompanied by music from the tambourine and harp,
>And he will attack them with his weapons.
###### 33
><span class=verse-body-poetry>33</span>For the burial place is already prepared;
>It has been made deep and wide for the king.
>The firewood is piled high on it.
>The Lᴏʀᴅ’s breath, like a stream flowing with brimstone,
>Will ignite it.
