###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>I relied completely on the Lᴏʀᴅ,
>And he turned toward me
>And heard my cry for help.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>He lifted me out of the watery pit,
>Out of the slimy mud.
>He placed my feet on a rock
>And gave me secure footing.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>He gave me reason to sing a new song,
>Praising our God.
>May many see what God has done,
>So that they might swear allegiance to him and trust in the Lᴏʀᴅ.

###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span>How blessed is the one who trusts in the Lᴏʀᴅ
>And does not seek help from the proud or from liars.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ, my God, you have accomplished many things;
>You have done amazing things and carried out your purposes for us.
>No one can thwart you.
>I want to declare your deeds and talk about them,
>But they are too numerous to recount.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 6
><span class=verse-first-poetry>6</span>Receiving sacrifices and offerings are not your primary concern.
>You make that quite clear to me.
>You do not ask for burnt sacrifices and sin offerings.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Then I say,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, I come!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>What is written in the scroll pertains to me.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I want to do what pleases you, my God.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your law dominates my thoughts.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span>I have told the great assembly about your justice.
>Look, I spare no words.
>O Lᴏʀᴅ, you know this is true.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>I have not failed to tell about your justice;
>I spoke about your reliability and deliverance.
>I have not neglected to tell the great assembly about your loyal love and faithfulness.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
><span class=verse-first-poetry>11</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ, you do not withhold your compassion from me.
>May your loyal love and faithfulness continually protect me!
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>For innumerable dangers surround me.
>My sins overtake me
>So I am unable to see;
>They outnumber the hairs of my head
>So my strength fails me.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span>Please be willing, O Lᴏʀᴅ, to rescue me!
>O Lᴏʀᴅ, hurry and help me!
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>May those who are trying to snatch away my life
>Be totally embarrassed and ashamed.
>May those who want to harm me
>Be turned back and ashamed.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>May those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!”
>Be humiliated and disgraced.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>May all those who seek you be happy and rejoice in you.
>May those who love to experience your deliverance say continually,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>May the Lᴏʀᴅ be praised!”
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>I am oppressed and needy.
>May the Lord pay attention to me.
>You are my helper and my deliverer.
>O my God, do not delay.
