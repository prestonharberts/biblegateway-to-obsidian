## Serving Faithfully Despite Hardship
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>So you, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>And what you heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to faithful people who will be competent to teach others as well.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>Take your share of suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>No one in military service gets entangled in matters of everyday life; otherwise he will not please the one who recruited him.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>Also, if anyone competes as an athlete, he will not be crowned as the winner unless he competes according to the rules.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>The farmer who works hard ought to have the first share of the crops.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>Think about what I am saying and the Lord will give you understanding of all this.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David; such is my gospel,
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>for which I suffer hardship to the point of imprisonment as a criminal, but God’s message is not imprisoned!
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>So I endure all things for the sake of those chosen by God, that they too may obtain salvation in Christ Jesus and its eternal glory.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>This saying is trustworthy:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

>If we died with him, we will also live with him.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>If we endure, we will also reign with him.
>If we deny him, he will also deny us.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>If we are unfaithful, he remains faithful, since he cannot deny himself.
## Dealing with False Teachers
###### 14
<span class=verse-first>14</span>Remind people of these things and solemnly charge them before the Lord not to wrangle over words. This is of no benefit; it just brings ruin on those who listen.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>Make every effort to present yourself before God as a proven worker who does not need to be ashamed, teaching the message of truth accurately.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>But avoid profane chatter, because those occupied with it will stray further and further into ungodliness,
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>and their message will spread its infection like gangrene. Hymenaeus and Philetus are in this group.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>They have strayed from the truth by saying that the resurrection has already occurred, and they are undermining some people’s faith.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>However, God’s solid foundation remains standing, bearing this seal: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and “Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from evil.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 20
<span class=verse-first>20</span>Now in a wealthy home there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also ones made of wood and of clay, and some are for honorable use, but others for ignoble use.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>So if someone cleanses himself of such behavior, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart, useful for the Master, prepared for every good work.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>But keep away from youthful passions, and pursue righteousness, faithfulness, love, and peace, in company with others who call on the Lord from a pure heart.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>But reject foolish and ignorant controversies, because you know they breed infighting.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>And the Lord’s slave must not engage in heated disputes but be kind toward all, an apt teacher, patient,
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>correcting opponents with gentleness. Perhaps God will grant them repentance and then knowledge of the truth
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>and they will come to their senses and escape the devil’s trap where they are held captive to do his will.
