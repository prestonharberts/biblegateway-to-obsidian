###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Have mercy on me, O God, because of your loyal love.
>Because of your great compassion, wipe away my rebellious acts.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Wash away my wrongdoing.
>Cleanse me of my sin.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>For I am aware of my rebellious acts;
>I am forever conscious of my sin.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>Against you—you above all—I have sinned;
>I have done what is evil in your sight.
>So you are just when you confront me;
>You are right when you condemn me.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 5
><span class=verse-first-poetry>5</span>Look, I was guilty of sin from birth,
>A sinner the moment my mother conceived me.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Look, you desire integrity in the inner man;
>You want me to possess wisdom.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Cleanse me with hyssop and I will be pure;
>Wash me and I will be whiter than snow.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Grant me the ultimate joy of being forgiven.
>May the bones you crushed rejoice.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>Hide your face from my sins.
>Wipe away all my guilt.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
><span class=verse-first-poetry>10</span>Create for me a pure heart, O God.
>Renew a resolute spirit within me.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Do not reject me.
>Do not take your holy Spirit away from me.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Let me again experience the joy of your deliverance.
>Sustain me by giving me the desire to obey.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>Then I will teach rebels your merciful ways,
>And sinners will turn to you.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
><span class=verse-first-poetry>14</span>Rescue me from the guilt of murder, O God, the God who delivers me.
>Then my tongue will shout for joy because of your righteousness.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>O Lord, give me the words.
>Then my mouth will praise you.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>Certainly you do not want a sacrifice, or else I would offer it;
>You do not desire a burnt sacrifice.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>The sacrifice God desires is a humble spirit—
>O God, a humble and repentant heart you will not reject.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
><span class=verse-first-poetry>18</span>Because you favor Zion, do what is good for her.
>Fortify the walls of Jerusalem.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>Then you will accept the proper sacrifices, burnt sacrifices and whole offerings;
>Then bulls will be sacrificed on your altar.
