## Jehoahaz’s Reign over Israel
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>In the twenty-third year of the reign of Judah’s King Joash son of Ahaziah, Jehu’s son Jehoahaz became king over Israel. He reigned in Samaria for seventeen years.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>He did evil in the sight of the Lᴏʀᴅ. He continued in the sinful ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat who had encouraged Israel to sin; he did not repudiate those sins.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ was furious with Israel and handed them over to King Hazael of Syria and to Hazael’s son Ben Hadad for many years.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>Jehoahaz asked for the Lᴏʀᴅ’s mercy, and the Lᴏʀᴅ responded favorably, for he saw that Israel was oppressed by the king of Syria.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ provided a deliverer for Israel, and they were freed from Syria’s power. The Israelites once more lived in security.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>But they did not repudiate the sinful ways of the family of Jeroboam, who encouraged Israel to sin; they continued in those sins. There was even an Asherah pole standing in Samaria.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>Jehoahaz had no army left except for 50 horsemen, 10 chariots, and 10,000 foot soldiers. The king of Syria had destroyed his troops and trampled on them as dust.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>The rest of the events of Jehoahaz’s reign, including all his accomplishments and successes, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>Jehoahaz passed away and was buried in Samaria. His son Jehoash replaced him as king.
## Jehoash’s Reign over Israel
###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>In the thirty-seventh year of King Jehoash’s reign over Judah, Jehoahaz’s son Jehoash became king over Israel. He reigned in Samaria for sixteen years.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>He did evil in the sight of the Lᴏʀᴅ. He did not repudiate the sinful ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat who encouraged Israel to sin; he continued in those sins.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>The rest of the events of Jehoash’s reign, including all his accomplishments and his successful war with King Amaziah of Judah, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>Jehoash passed away and Jeroboam succeeded him on the throne. Jehoash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
## Elisha Makes One Final Prophecy
###### 14
<span class=verse-first>14</span>Now Elisha had a terminal illness. King Jehoash of Israel went down to visit him. He wept before him and said, “My father, my father! The chariot and horsemen of Israel!”
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>Elisha told him, “Take a bow and some arrows,” and he did so.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>Then Elisha told the king of Israel, “Aim the bow.” He did so, and Elisha placed his hands on the king’s hands.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>Elisha said, “Open the east window,” and he did so. Elisha said, “Shoot!” and he did so. Elisha said, “This arrow symbolizes the victory the Lᴏʀᴅ will give you over Syria. You will annihilate Syria in Aphek!”
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>Then Elisha said, “Take the arrows,” and he did so. He told the king of Israel, “Strike the ground!” He struck the ground three times and stopped.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>The prophet got angry at him and said, “If you had struck the ground five or six times, you would have annihilated Syria! But now, you will defeat Syria only three times.”

###### 20
<span class=verse-first>20</span>Elisha died and was buried. Moabite raiding parties invaded the land at the beginning of the year.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>One day some men were burying a man when they spotted a raiding party. So they threw the dead man into Elisha’s tomb. When the body touched Elisha’s bones, the dead man came to life and stood on his feet.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 22
<span class=verse-first>22</span>Now King Hazael of Syria oppressed Israel throughout Jehoahaz’s reign.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>But the Lᴏʀᴅ had mercy on them and felt pity for them. He extended his favor to them because of the promise he had made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He has been unwilling to destroy them or remove them from his presence to this very day.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 24
<span class=verse-first>24</span>When King Hazael of Syria died, his son Ben Hadad replaced him as king.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>Jehoahaz’s son Jehoash took back from Ben Hadad son of Hazael the cities that he had taken from his father Jehoahaz in war. Jehoash defeated him three times and recovered the Israelite cities.
