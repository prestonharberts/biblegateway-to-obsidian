###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>I decided, “I will watch what I say
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And make sure I do not sin with my tongue.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will put a muzzle over my mouth
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>While in the presence of an evil person.”
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>I was stone silent;
>I held back the urge to speak.
>My frustration grew;
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>My anxiety intensified.
>As I thought about it, I became impatient.
>Finally I spoke these words:
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ, help me understand my mortality
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the brevity of life.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let me realize how quickly my life will pass.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, you make my days short-lived,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And my life span is nothing from your perspective.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Surely all people, even those who seem secure, are nothing but vapor. (Selah)
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Surely people go through life as mere ghosts.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Surely they accumulate worthless wealth
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Without knowing who will eventually haul it away.”

###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span>But now, O Lord, upon what am I relying?
>You are my only hope!
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Deliver me from all my sins of rebellion.
>Do not make me the object of fools’ insults.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>I am silent and cannot open my mouth
>Because of what you have done.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Please stop wounding me.
>You have almost beaten me to death.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>You severely discipline people for their sins;
>Like a moth you slowly devour their strength.
>Surely all people are a mere vapor. (Selah)

###### 12
><span class=verse-first-poetry>12</span>Hear my prayer, O Lᴏʀᴅ.
>Listen to my cry for help.
>Do not ignore my sobbing.
>For I am a resident foreigner with you,
>A temporary settler, just as all my ancestors were.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>Turn your angry gaze away from me, so I can be happy
>Before I pass away.
