## Admonition to Avoid Seduction to Evil
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>My child, be attentive to my wisdom,
>Pay close attention to my understanding,
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>In order to safeguard discretion,
>And that your lips may guard knowledge.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey,
>And her seductive words are smoother than olive oil,
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>But in the end she is bitter as wormwood,
>Sharp as a two-edged sword.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Her feet go down to death;
>Her steps lead straight to the grave.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Lest she should make level the path leading to life,
>Her paths have wandered, but she is not able to discern it.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span>So now, children, listen to me;
>Do not turn aside from the words I speak.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Keep yourself far from her,
>And do not go near the door of her house,
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>Lest you give your vigor to others
>And your years to a cruel person,
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Lest strangers devour your strength,
>And your labor benefit another man’s house.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>And at the end of your life you will groan
>When your flesh and your body are wasted away.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>And you will say, “How I hated discipline!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My heart spurned reproof!
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I did not obey my teachers
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I did not heed my instructors.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I almost came to complete ruin
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In the midst of the whole congregation!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
><span class=verse-first-poetry>15</span>Drink water from your own cistern
>And running water from your own well.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>Should your springs be dispersed outside,
>Your streams of water in the wide plazas?
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>Let them be for yourself alone,
>And not for strangers with you.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>May your fountain be blessed,
>And may you rejoice in the wife you married in your youth—
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>A loving doe, a graceful deer;
>May her breasts satisfy you at all times,
>May you be captivated by her love always.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>But why should you be captivated, my son, by an adulteress,
>And embrace the bosom of a different woman?
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>For the ways of a person are in front of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s eyes,
>And the Lᴏʀᴅ weighs all that person’s paths.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>The wicked will be captured by his own iniquities,
>And he will be held by the cords of his own sin.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span>He will die because there was no discipline;
>Because of the greatness of his folly he will reel.
