## Daniel Prays for His People
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>In the first year of Darius son of Ahasuerus, who was of Median descent and who had been appointed king over the Babylonian empire—
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, came to understand from the sacred books that the number of years for the fulfilling of the desolation of Jerusalem, which had come as the Lᴏʀᴅ’s message to the prophet Jeremiah, would be 70 years.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>So I turned my attention to the Lord God to implore him by prayer and requests, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>I prayed to the Lᴏʀᴅ my God, confessing in this way:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

“O Lord, great and awesome God who is faithful to his covenant with those who love him and keep his commandments,
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“we have sinned! We have done what is wrong and wicked; we have rebelled by turning away from your commandments and standards.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>“We have not paid attention to your servants the prophets, who spoke by your authority to our kings, our leaders, and our ancestors, and to all the inhabitants of the land as well.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
<span class=verse-first>7</span>“You are righteous, O Lord, but we are humiliated this day—the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel, both near and far away in all the countries in which you have scattered them, because they have behaved unfaithfully toward you.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>“O Lᴏʀᴅ, we have been humiliated—our kings, our leaders, and our ancestors—because we have sinned against you.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>“Yet the Lord our God is compassionate and forgiving, even though we have rebelled against him.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“We have not obeyed the Lᴏʀᴅ our God by living according to his laws that he set before us through his servants the prophets.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>“All Israel has broken your law and turned away by not obeying you. Therefore you have poured out on us the judgment solemnly threatened in the law of Moses the servant of God, for we have sinned against you.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>“He has carried out his threats against us and our rulers who were over us by bringing great calamity on us—what has happened to Jerusalem has never been equaled under all heaven!
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>“Just as it is written in the law of Moses, so all this calamity has come on us. Still we have not tried to pacify the Lᴏʀᴅ our God by turning back from our sin and by seeking wisdom from your reliable moral standards.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>“The Lᴏʀᴅ was mindful of the calamity, and he brought it on us. For the Lᴏʀᴅ our God is just in all he has done, and we have not obeyed him.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>“Now, O Lord our God, who brought your people out of the land of Egypt with great power and made a name for yourself that is remembered to this day—we have sinned and behaved wickedly.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>“O Lord, according to all your justice, please turn your raging anger away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain. For due to our sins and the iniquities of our ancestors, Jerusalem and your people are mocked by all our neighbors.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>“So now, our God, accept the prayer and requests of your servant, and show favor to your devastated sanctuary for your own sake.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>“Listen attentively, my God, and hear! Open your eyes and look on our desolated ruins and the city called by your name. For it is not because of our own righteous deeds that we are praying to you, but because your compassion is abundant.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>“O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, pay attention, and act! Don’t delay, for your own sake, O my God! For your city and your people are called by your name.”
## Gabriel Gives to Daniel a Prophecy of Seventy Weeks
###### 20
<span class=verse-first>20</span>While I was still speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and presenting my request before the Lᴏʀᴅ my God concerning his holy mountain—
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>yes, while I was still praying, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen previously in a vision, was approaching me in my state of extreme weariness, around the time of the evening offering.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>He spoke with me, instructing me as follows: “Daniel, I have now come to impart understanding to you.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>“At the beginning of your requests a message went out, and I have come to convey it to you, for you are of great value in God’s sight. Therefore consider the message and understand the vision:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 24
><span class=verse-first-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Seventy weeks have been determined
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Concerning your people and your holy city
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To put an end to rebellion,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To bring sin to completion,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To atone for iniquity,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To bring in perpetual righteousness,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To seal up the prophetic vision,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And to anoint a Most Holy Place.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So know and understand:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>From the issuing of the command to restore and rebuild
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Jerusalem until an anointed one, a prince arrives,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There will be a period of seven weeks and sixty-two weeks.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will again be built, with plaza and moat,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But in distressful times.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Now after the sixty-two weeks,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>An anointed one will be cut off and have nothing.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As for the city and the sanctuary,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The people of the coming prince will destroy them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But his end will come speedily like a flood.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Until the end of the war that has been decreed
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There will be destruction.
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will confirm a covenant with many for one week.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But in the middle of that week
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will bring sacrifices and offerings to a halt.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>On the wing of abominations will come one who destroys,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Until the decreed end is poured out on the one who destroys.”
