## Book 4 (Psalms 90-106)
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>O Lord, you have been our protector through all generations.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Even before the mountains came into existence,
>Or you brought the world into being,
>You were the eternal God.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 3
><span class=verse-first-poetry>3</span>You make mankind return to the dust,
>And say, “Return, O people.”
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>Yes, in your eyes a thousand years
>Are like yesterday that quickly passes,
>Or like one of the divisions of the nighttime.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>You bring their lives to an end and they “fall asleep.”
>In the morning they are like the grass that sprouts up:
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>In the morning it glistens and sprouts up;
>At evening time it withers and dries up.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span>Yes, we are consumed by your anger;
>We are terrified by your wrath.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>You are aware of our sins;
>You even know about our hidden sins.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>Yes, throughout all our days we experience your raging fury;
>The years of our lives pass quickly, like a sigh.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>The days of our lives add up to seventy years,
>Or eighty, if one is especially strong.
>But even one’s best years are marred by trouble and oppression.
>Yes, they pass quickly and we fly away.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Who can really fathom the intensity of your anger?
>Your raging fury causes people to fear you.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>So teach us to consider our mortality,
>So that we might live wisely.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span>Turn back toward us, O Lᴏʀᴅ.
>How long must this suffering last?
>Have pity on your servants.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>Satisfy us in the morning with your loyal love.
>Then we will shout for joy and be happy all our days.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>Make us happy in proportion to the days you have afflicted us,
>In proportion to the years we have experienced trouble.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>May your servants see your work.
>May their sons see your majesty.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>May our Sovereign God extend his favor to us.
>Make our endeavors successful.
>Yes, make them successful.
