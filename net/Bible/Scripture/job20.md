## Zophar’s Second Speech
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Then Zophar the Naamathite answered:

###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>This is why my troubled thoughts bring me back—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because of my feelings within me.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When I hear a reproof that dishonors me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then my understanding prompts me to answer.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Surely you know that it has been from old,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Ever since humankind was placed on the earth,
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That the elation of the wicked is brief,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The joy of the godless lasts but a moment.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even though his stature reaches to the heavens
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And his head touches the clouds,
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will perish forever, like his own excrement;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those who used to see him will say, ‘Where is he?’
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a dream he flies away, never again to be found,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And like a vision of the night he is put to flight.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>People who had seen him will not see him again,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the place where he was
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will recognize him no longer.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His sons must recompense the poor;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His own hands must return his wealth.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His bones were full of his youthful vigor,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But that vigor will lie down with him in the dust.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 12
><span class=verse-first-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If evil is sweet in his mouth
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And he hides it under his tongue,
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If he retains it for himself
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And does not let it go,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And holds it fast in his mouth,
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His food is turned sour in his stomach;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It becomes the venom of serpents within him.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The wealth that he consumed he vomits up,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>God will make him throw it out of his stomach.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He sucks the poison of serpents;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The fangs of a viper kill him.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will not look on the streams,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The rivers that are the torrents
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Of honey and butter.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He gives back the ill-gotten gain
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Without assimilating it;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will not enjoy the wealth from his commerce.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For he has oppressed the poor and abandoned them;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He has seized a house which he did not build.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 20
><span class=verse-first-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For he knows no satisfaction in his appetite;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He does not let anything he desires escape.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Nothing is left for him to devour;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That is why his prosperity does not last.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In the fullness of his sufficiency,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Distress overtakes him.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The full force of misery will come upon him.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>While he is filling his belly,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>God sends his burning anger against him,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And rains down his blows upon him.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If he flees from an iron weapon,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then an arrow from a bronze bow pierces him.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When he pulls it out and it comes out of his back,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The gleaming point out of his liver,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Terrors come over him.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Total darkness waits to receive his treasures;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A fire that has not been kindled
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will consume him and devour what is left in his tent.
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The heavens reveal his iniquity;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The earth rises up against him.
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A flood will carry off his house,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Rushing waters on the day of God’s wrath.
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Such is the lot God allots the wicked,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the heritage of his appointment from God.”
