## An Object Lesson from Ruined Linen Shorts
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said to me, “Go and buy some linen shorts and put them on. Do not put them in water.”
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>So I bought the shorts in keeping with the Lord’s instructions and put them on.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>Then the Lord’s message came to me again,
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“Take the shorts that you bought and are wearing and go at once to Perath. Bury the shorts there in a crack in the rocks.”
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>So I went and buried them at Perath as the Lᴏʀᴅ had ordered me to do.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>Many days later the Lᴏʀᴅ said to me, “Go at once to Perath and get the shorts I ordered you to bury there.”
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>So I went to Perath and dug up the shorts from the place where I had buried them. I found that they were ruined; they were good for nothing.

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>Then the Lord’s message came to me,
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>“I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, say: ‘This shows how I will ruin the highly exalted position in which Judah and Jerusalem take pride.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>‘These wicked people refuse to obey what I have said. They follow the stubborn inclinations of their own hearts and pay allegiance to other gods by worshiping and serving them. So they will become just like these linen shorts that are good for nothing.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>‘For,’ I say, ‘just as shorts cling tightly to a person’s body, so I bound the whole nation of Israel and the whole nation of Judah tightly to me.’ I intended for them to be my special people and to bring me fame, honor, and praise. But they would not obey me.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 12
<span class=verse-first>12</span>“So tell them, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ, the God of Israel, says: “Every wine jar is made to be filled with wine.”’ And they will probably say to you, ‘Do you not think we know that every wine jar is supposed to be filled with wine?’
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>“Then tell them, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ says: “I will soon fill all the people who live in this land with stupor. I will also fill the kings from David’s dynasty, the priests, the prophets, and the citizens of Jerusalem with stupor.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>‘And I will smash them like wine bottles against one another, children and parents alike. I will not show any pity, mercy, or compassion. Nothing will keep me from destroying them,’ says the Lᴏʀᴅ.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>Then I said to the people of Judah:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Listen and pay attention! Do not be arrogant!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ has spoken.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Show the Lᴏʀᴅ your God the respect that is due him.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do it before he brings the darkness of disaster.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do it before you stumble into distress
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a traveler on the mountains at twilight.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do it before he turns the light of deliverance you hope for
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Into the darkness and gloom of exile.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But if you will not pay attention to this warning,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will weep alone because of your arrogant pride.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will weep bitterly, and my eyes will overflow with tears
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because you, the Lᴏʀᴅ’s flock, will be carried into exile.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ told me:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Tell the king and the queen mother,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Surrender your thrones,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For your glorious crowns
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Will be removed from your heads.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The gates of the towns in southern Judah will be shut tight.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>No one will be able to go in or out of them.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>All Judah will be carried off into exile.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They will be completely carried off into exile.’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 20
<span class=verse-first>20</span>Then I said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look up, Jerusalem, and see
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The enemy that is coming from the north.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Where now is the flock of people that were entrusted to your care?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Where now are the ‘sheep’ that you take such pride in?
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>What will you say when the Lᴏʀᴅ appoints as rulers over you those allies
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That you, yourself, had actually prepared as such?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then anguish and agony will grip you
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like that of a woman giving birth to a baby.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will probably ask yourself,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Why have these things happened to me?
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Why have I been treated like a disgraced adulteress
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Whose skirt has been torn off and her limbs exposed?’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It is because you have sinned so much.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But there is little hope for you ever doing good,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You who are so accustomed to doing evil.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Can an Ethiopian change the color of his skin?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Can a leopard remove its spots?
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>“The Lᴏʀᴅ says,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>That is why I will scatter your people like chaff
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>That is blown away by a desert wind.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>This is your fate,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The destiny to which I have appointed you,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Because you have forgotten me
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And have trusted in false gods.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>So I will pull your skirt up over your face
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And expose you to shame like a disgraced adulteress!
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>People of Jerusalem, I have seen your adulterous worship,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Your shameless prostitution to, and your lustful pursuit of, other gods.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I have seen your disgusting acts of worship
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>On the hills throughout the countryside.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You are doomed to destruction!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>How long will you continue to be unclean?’”
