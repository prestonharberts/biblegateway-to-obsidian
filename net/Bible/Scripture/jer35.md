## Judah’s Unfaithfulness Contrasted with the Rechabites’ Faithfulness
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ spoke to Jeremiah when Jehoiakim son of Josiah was ruling over Judah:
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“Go to the Rechabite community. Invite them to come into one of the side rooms of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple and offer them some wine to drink.”
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>So I went and got Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah the grandson of Habazziniah, his brothers, all his sons, and all the rest of the Rechabite community.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>I took them to the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple. I took them into the room where the disciples of the prophet Hanan son of Igdaliah stayed. That room was next to the one where the temple officers stayed and above the room where Maaseiah son of Shallum, one of the doorkeepers of the temple, stayed.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>Then I set cups and pitchers full of wine in front of the members of the Rechabite community and said to them, “Have some wine.”
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>But they answered, “We do not drink wine because our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab commanded us not to. He told us, ‘You and your children must never drink wine.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>‘Do not build houses. Do not plant crops. Do not plant a vineyard or own one. Live in tents all your lives. If you do these things you will live a long time in the land that you wander about on.’
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>“We and our wives and our sons and daughters have obeyed everything our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab commanded us. We have never drunk wine.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>“We have not built any houses to live in. We do not own any vineyards, fields, or crops.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“We have lived in tents. We have obeyed our ancestor Jonadab and done exactly as he commanded us.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>“But when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon invaded the land we said, ‘Let’s get up and go to Jerusalem to get away from the Babylonian and Aramean armies.’ That is why we are staying here in Jerusalem.”

###### 12
<span class=verse-first>12</span>Then the Lord’s message came to Jeremiah.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, told him, “Go and speak to the people of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem. Tell them, ‘I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, say: “You must learn a lesson from this about obeying what I say.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>‘Jonadab son of Rechab ordered his descendants not to drink wine. His orders have been carried out. To this day his descendants have drunk no wine because they have obeyed what their ancestor commanded them. But I have spoken to you over and over again, but you have not obeyed me.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>‘I sent all my servants the prophets to warn you over and over again. They said, ‘Every one of you, stop doing the evil things you have been doing and do what is right. Do not pay allegiance to other gods and worship them. Then you can continue to live in this land that I gave to you and your ancestors.’ But you did not pay any attention or listen to me.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>“Yes, the descendants of Jonadab son of Rechab have carried out the orders that their ancestor gave them. But you people have not obeyed me!
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>“So I, the Lᴏʀᴅ God of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, say: ‘I will soon bring on Judah and all the citizens of Jerusalem all the disaster that I threatened to bring on them. I will do this because I spoke to them but they did not listen. I called out to them but they did not answer.’”’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span>Then Jeremiah spoke to the Rechabite community, “The Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel says, ‘You have obeyed the orders of your ancestor Jonadab. You have followed all his instructions. You have done exactly as he commanded you.’
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>“So the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says, ‘Jonadab son of Rechab will never lack a male descendant to serve me.’”
