## The Brevity of Life
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Does not humanity have hard service on earth?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Are not their days also like the days of a hired man?
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a servant longing for the evening shadow,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And like a hired man looking for his wages,
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Thus I have been made to inherit
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Months of futility,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And nights of sorrow
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Have been appointed to me.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If I lie down, I say, ‘When will I arise?’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the night stretches on
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I toss and turn restlessly
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Until the day dawns.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My body is clothed with worms and dirty scabs;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My skin is broken and festering.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And they come to an end without hope.

###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Remember that my life is but a breath,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That my eyes will never again see happiness.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The eye of him who sees me now will see me no more;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your eyes will look for me, but I will be gone.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As a cloud is dispersed and then disappears,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So the one who goes down to the grave
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Does not come up again.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He returns no more to his house,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Nor does his place of residence know him anymore.”
## Job Remonstrates with God
###### 11
><span class=verse-first-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Therefore, I will not refrain my mouth;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Am I the sea, or the creature of the deep,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That you must put me under guard?
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If I say, ‘My bed will comfort me,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>My couch will ease my complaint,’
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then you scare me with dreams
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And terrify me with visions,
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So that I would prefer strangling,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And death more than life.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I loathe it; I do not want to live forever;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Leave me alone, for my days are a vapor!”
## Insignificance of Humans
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>What is mankind that you make so much of them,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And that you pay attention to them?
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And that you visit them every morning,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And try them every moment?
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will you never look away from me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will you not let me alone
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Long enough to swallow my spittle?
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If I have sinned—what have I done to you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>O watcher of men?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why have you set me as your target?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Have I become a burden to you?
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And why do you not pardon my transgression,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And take away my iniquity?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For now I will lie down in the dust,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And you will seek me diligently,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But I will be gone.”
