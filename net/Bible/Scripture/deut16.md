## The Passover
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Observe the month Abib and keep the Passover to the Lᴏʀᴅ your God, for in that month he brought you out of Egypt by night.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>You must sacrifice the Passover animal (from the flock or the herd) to the Lᴏʀᴅ your God in the place where he chooses to locate his name.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>You must not eat any yeast with it; for seven days you must eat bread made without yeast, as symbolic of affliction, for you came out of Egypt hurriedly. You must do this so you will remember for the rest of your lives the day you came out of the land of Egypt.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>There must not be a scrap of yeast within your land for seven days, nor can any of the meat you sacrifice on the evening of the first day remain until the next morning.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>You may not sacrifice the Passover in just any of your villages that the Lᴏʀᴅ your God is giving you,
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>but you must sacrifice it in the evening in the place where he chooses to locate his name, at sunset, the time of day you came out of Egypt.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>You must cook and eat it in the place the Lᴏʀᴅ your God chooses; you may return the next morning to your tents.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>You must eat bread made without yeast for six days. The seventh day you are to hold an assembly for the Lᴏʀᴅ your God; you must not do any work on that day.
## The Feast of Weeks
###### 9
<span class=verse-first>9</span>You must count seven weeks; you must begin to count them from the time you begin to harvest the standing grain.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>Then you are to celebrate the Feast of Weeks before the Lᴏʀᴅ your God with the voluntary offering that you will bring, in proportion to how he has blessed you.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>You shall rejoice before him—you, your son, your daughter, your male and female slaves, the Levites in your villages, the resident foreigners, the orphans, and the widows among you—in the place where the Lᴏʀᴅ chooses to locate his name.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>Furthermore, remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and so be careful to observe these statutes.
## The Feast of Temporary Shelters
###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>You must celebrate the Feast of Shelters for seven days, at the time of the grain and grape harvest.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>You are to rejoice in your festival, you, your son, your daughter, your male and female slaves, the Levites, the resident foreigners, the orphans, and the widows who are in your villages.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>You are to celebrate the festival seven days before the Lᴏʀᴅ your God in the place he chooses, for he will bless you in all your productivity and in whatever you do; so you will indeed rejoice!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 16
<span class=verse-first>16</span>Three times a year all your males must appear before the Lᴏʀᴅ your God in the place he chooses for the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Shelters; and they must not appear before him empty-handed.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>Every one of you must give as you are able, according to the blessing of the Lᴏʀᴅ your God that he has given you.
## Provision for Justice
###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span>You must appoint judges and civil servants for each tribe in all your villages that the Lᴏʀᴅ your God is giving you, and they must judge the people fairly.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>You must not pervert justice or show favor. Do not take a bribe, for bribes blind the eyes of the wise and distort the words of the righteous.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>You must pursue justice alone so that you may live and inherit the land the Lᴏʀᴅ your God is giving you.
## Examples of Legal Cases
###### 21
<span class=verse-first>21</span>You must not plant any kind of tree as a sacred Asherah pole near the altar of the Lᴏʀᴅ your God which you build for yourself.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>You must not erect a sacred pillar, a thing the Lᴏʀᴅ your God detests.
