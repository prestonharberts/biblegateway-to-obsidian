###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Listen, O God, to my prayer.
>Do not ignore my appeal for mercy.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Pay attention to me and answer me.
>I am so upset and distressed, I am beside myself,
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Because of what the enemy says,
>And because of how the wicked pressure me,
>For they hurl trouble down upon me
>And angrily attack me.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span>My heart beats violently within me;
>The horrors of death overcome me.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Fear and panic overpower me;
>Terror overwhelms me.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>I say, “I wish I had wings like a dove.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I would fly away and settle in a safe place.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, I will escape to a distant place;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will stay in the wilderness. (Selah)
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will hurry off to a place that is safe
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>From the strong wind and the gale.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span>Confuse them, O Lord.
>Frustrate their plans.
>For I see violence and conflict in the city.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Day and night they walk around on its walls,
>While wickedness and destruction are within it.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Disaster is within it;
>Violence and deceit do not depart from its public square.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 12
><span class=verse-first-poetry>12</span>Indeed, it is not an enemy who insults me,
>Or else I could bear it;
>It is not one who hates me who arrogantly taunts me,
>Or else I could hide from him.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>But it is you, a man like me,
>My close friend in whom I confided.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>We would share personal thoughts with each other;
>In God’s temple we would walk together among the crowd.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>May death destroy them.
>May they go down alive into Sheol.
>For evil is in their dwelling place and in their midst.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 16
><span class=verse-first-poetry>16</span>As for me, I will call out to God,
>And the Lᴏʀᴅ will deliver me.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>During the evening, morning, and noontime
>I will lament and moan,
>And he will hear me.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>He will rescue me and protect me from those who attack me,
>Even though they greatly outnumber me.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>God, the one who has reigned as king from long ago,
>Will hear and humiliate them. (Selah)
>They refuse to change,
>And do not fear God.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>He attacks his friends;
>He breaks his solemn promises to them.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>His words are as smooth as butter,
>But he harbors animosity in his heart.
>His words seem softer than oil,
>But they are really like sharp swords.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 22
><span class=verse-first-poetry>22</span>Throw your burden upon the Lᴏʀᴅ,
>And he will sustain you.
>He will never allow the godly to be shaken.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span>But you, O God, will bring them down to the deep Pit.
>Violent and deceitful people will not live even half a normal lifespan.
>But as for me, I trust in you.
