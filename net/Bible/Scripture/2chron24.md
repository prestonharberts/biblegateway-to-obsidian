## Joash’s Reign
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Joash was seven years old when he began to reign. He reigned for forty years in Jerusalem. His mother was Zibiah, who was from Beer Sheba.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>Joash did what the Lᴏʀᴅ approved throughout the lifetime of Jehoiada the priest.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>Jehoiada chose two wives for him who gave him sons and daughters.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 4
<span class=verse-first>4</span>Later, Joash was determined to repair the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>He assembled the priests and Levites and ordered them, “Go out to the cities of Judah and collect the annual quota of silver from all Israel for repairs on the temple of your God. Be quick about it!” But the Levites delayed.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>So the king summoned Jehoiada the chief priest, and said to him, “Why have you not made the Levites collect from Judah and Jerusalem the tax authorized by Moses the Lᴏʀᴅ’s servant and by the assembly of Israel at the tent containing the tablets of the law?”
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>(Wicked Athaliah and her sons had broken into God’s temple and used all the holy items of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple in their worship of the Baals.)
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>The king ordered a chest to be made and placed outside the gate of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>An edict was sent throughout Judah and Jerusalem requiring the people to bring to the Lᴏʀᴅ the tax that Moses, God’s servant, imposed on Israel in the wilderness.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>All the officials and all the people gladly brought their silver and threw it into the chest until it was full.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>Whenever the Levites brought the chest to the royal accountant and they saw there was a lot of silver, the royal scribe and the accountant of the high priest emptied the chest and then took it back to its place. They went through this routine every day and collected a large amount of silver.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>The king and Jehoiada gave it to the construction foremen assigned to the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple. They hired carpenters and craftsmen to repair the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple, as well as those skilled in working with iron and bronze to restore the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>They worked hard and made the repairs. They followed the measurements specified for God’s temple and restored it.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>When they were finished, they brought the rest of the silver to the king and Jehoiada. They used it to make items for the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple, including items used in the temple service and for burnt sacrifices, pans, and various other gold and silver items. Throughout Jehoiada’s lifetime, burnt sacrifices were offered regularly in the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>Jehoiada grew old and died at the age of 130.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>He was buried in the City of David with the kings, because he had accomplished good in Israel and for God and his temple.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
<span class=verse-first>17</span>After Jehoiada died, the officials of Judah visited the king and declared their loyalty to him. The king listened to their advice.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>They abandoned the temple of the Lᴏʀᴅ God of their ancestors and worshiped the Asherah poles and idols. Because of this sinful activity, God was angry with Judah and Jerusalem.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ sent prophets among them to lead them back to him. They warned the people, but they would not pay attention.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 20
<span class=verse-first>20</span>God’s Spirit energized Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest. He stood up before the people and said to them, “This is what God says: ‘Why are you violating the commands of the Lᴏʀᴅ? You will not be prosperous. Because you have rejected the Lᴏʀᴅ, he has rejected you!’”
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>They plotted against him and by royal decree stoned him to death in the courtyard of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>King Joash disregarded the loyalty Zechariah’s father Jehoiada had shown him and killed Jehoiada’s son. As Zechariah was dying, he said, “May the Lᴏʀᴅ take notice and seek vengeance!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 23
<span class=verse-first>23</span>At the beginning of the year the Syrian army attacked Joash and invaded Judah and Jerusalem. They wiped out all the leaders of the people and sent all the plunder they gathered to the king of Damascus.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>Even though the invading Syrian army was relatively weak, the Lᴏʀᴅ handed over to them Judah’s very large army, for the people of Judah had abandoned the Lᴏʀᴅ God of their ancestors. The Syrians gave Joash what he deserved.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 25
<span class=verse-first>25</span>When they withdrew, they left Joash badly wounded. His servants plotted against him because of what he had done to the son of Jehoiada the priest. They murdered him on his bed. Thus he died and was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>The conspirators were Zabad son of Shimeath (an Ammonite woman) and Jehozabad son of Shimrith (a Moabite woman).
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>The list of Joash’s sons, the many prophetic oracles about him, and the account of his building project on God’s temple are included in the record of the Scroll of the Kings. His son Amaziah replaced him as king.
