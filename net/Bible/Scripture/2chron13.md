## Abijah’s Reign
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>In the eighteenth year of the reign of King Jeroboam, Abijah became king over Judah.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>He ruled for three years in Jerusalem. His mother was Michaiah, the daughter of Uriel from Gibeah.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>Abijah launched the attack with 400,000 well-trained warriors, while Jeroboam deployed against him 800,000 well-trained warriors.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 4
<span class=verse-first>4</span>Abijah ascended Mount Zemaraim, in the Ephraimite hill country, and said: “Listen to me, Jeroboam and all Israel!
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“Don’t you realize that the Lᴏʀᴅ God of Israel has given David and his dynasty lasting dominion over Israel by a formal covenant?
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>“Jeroboam son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon son of David, rose up and rebelled against his master.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“Lawless good-for-nothing men gathered around him and conspired against Rehoboam son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was an inexperienced young man and could not resist them.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>“Now you are declaring that you will resist the Lᴏʀᴅ’s rule through the Davidic dynasty. You have a huge army, and bring with you the gold calves that Jeroboam made for you as gods.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>“But you banished the Lᴏʀᴅ’s priests, Aaron’s descendants, and the Levites, and appointed your own priests just as the surrounding nations do! Anyone who comes to consecrate himself with a young bull or seven rams becomes a priest of these fake gods!
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“But as for us, the Lᴏʀᴅ is our God and we have not rejected him. Aaron’s descendants serve as the Lᴏʀᴅ’s priests, and the Levites assist them with the work.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>“They offer burnt sacrifices to the Lᴏʀᴅ every morning and every evening, along with fragrant incense. They arrange the Bread of the Presence on a ritually clean table and light the lamps on the gold lampstand every evening. Certainly we are observing the Lᴏʀᴅ our God’s regulations, but you have rejected him.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>“Now look, God is with us as our leader. His priests are ready to blow the trumpets to signal the attack against you. You Israelites, don’t fight against the Lᴏʀᴅ God of your ancestors, for you will not win!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>Now Jeroboam had sent some men to ambush the Judahite army from behind. The main army was in front of the Judahite army; the ambushers were behind it.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>The men of Judah turned around and realized they were being attacked from the front and the rear. So they cried out to the Lᴏʀᴅ for help. The priests blew their trumpets,
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>and the men of Judah gave the battle cry. As the men of Judah gave the battle cry, God struck down Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>The Israelites fled from before the Judahite army, and God handed them over to the men of Judah.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>Abijah and his army thoroughly defeated them; 500,000 well-trained Israelite men fell dead.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>That day the Israelites were defeated; the men of Judah prevailed because they relied on the Lᴏʀᴅ God of their ancestors.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>Abijah chased Jeroboam; he seized from him these cities: Bethel and its surrounding towns, Jeshanah and its surrounding towns, and Ephron and its surrounding towns.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>Jeroboam did not regain power during the reign of Abijah. The Lᴏʀᴅ struck him down and he died.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 21
<span class=verse-first>21</span>Abijah’s power grew; he had fourteen wives and fathered twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>The rest of the events of Abijah’s reign, including his deeds and sayings, are recorded in the writings of the prophet Iddo.
