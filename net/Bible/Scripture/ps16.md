###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Protect me, O God, for I have taken shelter in you.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>I say to the Lᴏʀᴅ, “You are the Lord,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My only source of well-being.”
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>As for God’s chosen people who are in the land,
>And the leading officials I admired so much—
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>Their troubles multiply;
>They desire other gods.
>I will not pour out drink offerings of blood to their gods,
>Nor will I make vows in the name of their gods.

###### 5
><span class=verse-first-poetry>5</span>Lᴏʀᴅ, you give me stability and prosperity;

><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>I constantly trust in the Lᴏʀᴅ;
>Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>So my heart rejoices
>And I am happy;
>My life is safe.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>You will not abandon me to Sheol;
>You will not allow your faithful follower to see the Pit.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>You lead me in the path of life.
>I experience absolute joy in your presence;
>You always give me sheer delight.
