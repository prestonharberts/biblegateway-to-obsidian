<span class=verse-first>1</span>Then Job answered:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Truly, I know that this is so.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But how can a human be just before God?
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If someone wishes to contend with him,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He cannot answer him one time in a thousand.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He is wise in heart and mighty in strength—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who has resisted him and remained safe?
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He who removes mountains suddenly,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who overturns them in his anger,
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He who shakes the earth out of its place
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So that its pillars tremble,
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He who commands the sun, and it does not shine
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And seals up the stars,
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He alone spreads out the heavens,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And treads on the waves of the sea.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the constellations of the southern sky;
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He does great and unsearchable things,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And wonderful things without number.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If he passes by me, I cannot see him,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If he goes by, I cannot perceive him.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If he snatches away, who can turn him back?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who dares to say to him, ‘What are you doing?’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>God does not restrain his anger;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Under him the helpers of Rahab lie crushed.”
## The Impossibility of Facing God in Court
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How much less, then, can I answer him
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And choose my words to argue with him.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Although I am innocent,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I could not answer him;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I could only plead with my judge for mercy.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If I summoned him, and he answered me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I would not believe
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That he would be listening to my voice—
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He who crushes me with a tempest,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And multiplies my wounds for no reason.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He does not allow me to recover my breath,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For he fills me with bitterness.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If it is a matter of strength,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Most certainly he is the strong one!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And if it is a matter of justice,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will say, ‘Who will summon me?’
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Although I am innocent,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My mouth would condemn me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Although I am blameless,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It would declare me perverse.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I am blameless. I do not know myself.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I despise my life.”
## Accusation of God’s Justice
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It is all one! That is why I say,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He destroys the blameless and the guilty.’
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If a scourge brings sudden death,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He mocks at the despair of the innocent.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If a land has been given
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Into the hand of a wicked man,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He covers the faces of its judges;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If it is not he, then who is it?”
## Renewed Complaint
###### 25
><span class=verse-first-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My days are swifter than a runner,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They speed by without seeing happiness.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They glide by like reed boats,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like an eagle that swoops down on its prey.
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will change my expression and be cheerful,’
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I dread all my sufferings,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I know that you do not hold me blameless.
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If I am guilty,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why then weary myself in vain?
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If I wash myself with snow-melt water,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And make my hands clean with lye,
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then you plunge me into a slimy pit
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And my own clothes abhor me.
###### 32
><span class=verse-body-poetry>32</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For he is not a human being like I am,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That I might answer him,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That we might come together in judgment.
###### 33
><span class=verse-body-poetry>33</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Nor is there an arbiter between us,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who might lay his hand on us both,
###### 34
><span class=verse-body-poetry>34</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who would take his rod away from me
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So that his terror would not make me afraid.
###### 35
><span class=verse-body-poetry>35</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then would I speak and not fear him,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But it is not so with me.
