## The Brevity of Life
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Man, born of woman,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Lives but a few days, and they are full of trouble.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He grows up like a flower and then withers away;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He flees like a shadow, and does not remain.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do you fix your eye on such a one?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And do you bring me before you for judgment?
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who can make a clean thing come from an unclean?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No one!
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Since man’s days are determined,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The number of his months is under your control;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You have set his limit and he cannot pass it.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look away from him and let him desist,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Until he fulfills his time like a hired man.”
## The Inevitability of Death
###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But there is hope for a tree:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If it is cut down, it will sprout again,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And its new shoots will not fail.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Although its roots may grow old in the ground
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And its stump begins to die in the soil,
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>At the scent of water it will flourish
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And put forth shoots like a new plant.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But man dies and is powerless;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He expires—and where is he?
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As water disappears from the sea,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or a river drains away and dries up,
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So man lies down and does not rise;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Until the heavens are no more,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will not awake
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Nor arise from their sleep.”
## The Possibility of Another Life
###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>O that you would hide me in Sheol,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And conceal me till your anger has passed!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>O that you would set me a time
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And then remember me!
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If a man dies, will he live again?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All the days of my hard service I will wait
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Until my release comes.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will call and I—I will answer you;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will long for the creature you have made.”
## The Present Condition
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Surely now you count my steps;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then you would not mark my sin.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My offenses would be sealed up in a bag;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You would cover over my sin.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
><span class=verse-first-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But as a mountain falls away and crumbles,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And as a rock will be removed from its place,
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As water wears away stones,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And torrents wash away the soil,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So you destroy man’s hope.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You overpower him once for all,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And he departs;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You change his appearance
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And send him away.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If his sons are honored,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He does not know it;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If they are brought low,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He does not see it.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His flesh only has pain for him,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And he mourns for himself.”
