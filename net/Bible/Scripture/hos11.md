## Reversal of the Exodus: Return to Egypt and Exile in Assyria
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When Israel was a young man, I loved him like a son,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I summoned my son out of Egypt.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But the more I summoned them,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The farther they departed from me.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They sacrificed to the Baal idols
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And burned incense to images.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yet it was I who led Ephraim;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I took them by the arm,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But they did not acknowledge
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That I had healed them.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I drew them with leather cords,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>With straps of hide;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I lifted the yoke from their neck,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And gently fed them.

###### 5
><span class=verse-first-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will return to Egypt!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Assyria will rule over them
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because they refuse to repent!
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A sword will flash in their cities,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will destroy the bars of their city gates,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And will devour them in their fortresses.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My people are obsessed with turning away from me;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They call to Baal, but he will never exalt them!”
## The Divine Dilemma: Judgment or Mercy?
###### 8
><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How can I give you up, O Ephraim?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How can I surrender you, O Israel?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How can I treat you like Admah?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How can I make you like Zeboyim?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have had a change of heart.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All my tender compassions are aroused.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I cannot carry out my fierce anger!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I cannot totally destroy Ephraim!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because I am God, and not man—the Holy One among you—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will not come in wrath!”
## God Will Restore the Exiles to Israel
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will roar like a lion,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And they will follow the Lᴏʀᴅ;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When he roars,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His children will come trembling from the west.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will return in fear and trembling
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like birds from Egypt,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like doves from Assyria,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I will settle them in their homes,” declares the Lᴏʀᴅ.
## God’s Lawsuit against Israel: Breach of Covenant
###### 12
><span class=verse-first-poetry>12</span> Ephraim has surrounded me with lies;
>The house of Israel has surrounded me with deceit.
>But Judah still roams about with God;
>He remains faithful to the Holy One.
