###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>It is fitting to thank the Lᴏʀᴅ,
>And to sing praises to your name, O Most High.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>It is fitting to proclaim your loyal love in the morning,
>And your faithfulness during the night,
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>To the accompaniment of a ten-stringed instrument and a lyre,
>To the accompaniment of the meditative tone of the harp.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>For you, O Lᴏʀᴅ, have made me happy by your work.
>I will sing for joy because of what you have done.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 5
><span class=verse-first-poetry>5</span>How great are your works, O Lᴏʀᴅ!
>Your plans are very intricate!
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>The spiritually insensitive do not recognize this;
>The fool does not understand this.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>When the wicked sprout up like grass,
>And all the evildoers glisten,
>It is so that they may be annihilated.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>But you, O Lᴏʀᴅ, reign forever.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>Indeed, look at your enemies, O Lᴏʀᴅ.
>Indeed, look at how your enemies perish.
>All the evildoers are scattered.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
><span class=verse-first-poetry>10</span>You exalt my horn like that of a wild ox.
>I am covered with fresh oil.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>I gloat in triumph over those who tried to ambush me;
>I hear the defeated cries of the evil foes who attacked me.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>The godly grow like a palm tree;
>They grow high like a cedar in Lebanon.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>Planted in the Lᴏʀᴅ’s house,
>They grow in the courts of our God.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>They bear fruit even when they are old;
>They are filled with vitality and have many leaves.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>So they proclaim that the Lᴏʀᴅ, my Protector,
>Is just and never unfair.
