###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>As for you, the one who lives in the shelter of the Most High,
>And resides in the protective shadow of the Sovereign One—
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>I say this about the Lᴏʀᴅ, my shelter and my stronghold,
>My God in whom I trust—
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>He will certainly rescue you from the snare of the hunter
>And from the destructive plague.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>He will shelter you with his wings;
>You will find safety under his wings.
>His faithfulness is like a shield or a protective wall.

###### 5
><span class=verse-first-poetry>5</span>You need not fear the terrors of the night,
>The arrow that flies by day,
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>The plague that stalks in the darkness,
>Or the disease that ravages at noon.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Though a thousand may fall beside you,
>And a multitude on your right side,
>It will not reach you.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Certainly you will see it with your very own eyes—
>You will see the wicked paid back.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>For you have taken refuge in the Lᴏʀᴅ,
>My shelter, the Most High.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>No harm will overtake you;
>No illness will come near your home.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
><span class=verse-first-poetry>11</span>For he will order his angels
>To protect you in all you do.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>They will lift you up in their hands,
>So you will not slip and fall on a stone.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>You will subdue a lion and a snake;
>You will trample underfoot a young lion and a serpent.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
><span class=verse-first-poetry>14</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ says,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because he is devoted to me, I will deliver him;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will protect him because he is loyal to me.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When he calls out to me, I will answer him.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will be with him when he is in trouble;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will rescue him and bring him honor.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will satisfy him with long life,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And will let him see my salvation.”
