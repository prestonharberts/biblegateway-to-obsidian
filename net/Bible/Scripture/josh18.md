###### 2
<span class=verse-first>2</span>seven Israelite tribes had not been assigned their allotted land.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>So Joshua said to the Israelites: “How long do you intend to put off occupying the land the Lᴏʀᴅ God of your ancestors has given you?
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“Pick three men from each tribe. I will send them out to walk through the land and make a map of it for me.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“Divide it into seven regions. Judah will stay in its territory in the south, and the family of Joseph in its territory in the north.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>“But as for you, map out the land into seven regions and bring it to me. I will draw lots for you here before the Lᴏʀᴅ our God.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“But the Levites will not have an allotted portion among you, for their inheritance is to serve the Lᴏʀᴅ. Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have already received their allotted land east of the Jordan, which Moses the Lᴏʀᴅ’s servant assigned them.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>When the men started out, Joshua told those going to map out the land, “Go, walk through the land, map it out, and return to me. Then I will draw lots for you before the Lᴏʀᴅ here in Shiloh.”
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>The men journeyed through the land and mapped it and its cities out into seven regions on a scroll. Then they came to Joshua at the camp in Shiloh.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>Joshua drew lots for them in Shiloh before the Lᴏʀᴅ and divided the land among the Israelites according to their allotted portions.
