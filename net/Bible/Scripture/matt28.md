## The Resurrection
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Now after the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>Suddenly there was a severe earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descending from heaven came and rolled away the stone and sat on it.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>The guards were shaken and became like dead men because they were so afraid of him.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid; I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>“He is not here, for he has been raised, just as he said. Come and see the place where he was lying.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“Then go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has been raised from the dead. He is going ahead of you into Galilee. You will see him there.’ Listen, I have told you!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>So they left the tomb quickly, with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>But Jesus met them, saying, “Greetings!” They came to him, held on to his feet and worshiped him.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. They will see me there.”
## The Guards’ Report
###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>While they were going, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>After they had assembled with the elders and formed a plan, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>telling them, “You are to say, ‘His disciples came at night and stole his body while we were asleep.’
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>“If this matter is heard before the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.”
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>So they took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story is told among the Jews to this day.
## The Great Commission
###### 16
<span class=verse-first>16</span>So the eleven disciples went to Galilee to the mountain Jesus had designated.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>When they saw him, they worshiped him, but some doubted.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>Then Jesus came up and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>“Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>“teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”
