## Breaking Human Traditions
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Then Pharisees and experts in the law came from Jerusalem to Jesus and said,
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don’t wash their hands when they eat.”
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>He answered them, “And why do you disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition?
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother’ and ‘Whoever insults his father or mother must be put to death.’
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“But you say, ‘If someone tells his father or mother, “Whatever help you would have received from me is given to God,”
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>‘he does not need to honor his father.’ You have nullified the word of God on account of your tradition.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said,

###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>This people honors me with their lips,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>But their heart is far from me,
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And they worship me in vain,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’”
## True Defilement
###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>Then he called the crowd to him and said, “Listen and understand.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>“What defiles a person is not what goes into the mouth; it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles a person.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 12
<span class=verse-first>12</span>Then the disciples came to him and said, “Do you know that when the Pharisees heard this saying they were offended?”
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>And he replied, “Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>“Leave them! They are blind guides. If someone who is blind leads another who is blind, both will fall into a pit.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>But Peter said to him, “Explain this parable to us.”
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>Jesus said, “Even after all this, are you still so foolish?
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>“Don’t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth enters the stomach and then passes out into the sewer?
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>“But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these things defile a person.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>“For out of the heart come evil ideas, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>“These are the things that defile a person; it is not eating with unwashed hands that defiles a person.”
## A Canaanite Woman’s Faith
###### 21
<span class=verse-first>21</span>After going out from there, Jesus went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>A Canaanite woman from that area came and cried out, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is horribly demon-possessed!”
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>But he did not answer her a word. Then his disciples came and begged him, “Send her away, because she keeps on crying out after us.”
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>So he answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>But she came and bowed down before him and said, “Lord, help me!”
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>“It is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs,” he said.
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>“Yes, Lord,” she replied, “but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.”
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>Then Jesus answered her, “Woman, your faith is great! Let what you want be done for you.” And her daughter was healed from that hour.
## Healing Many Others
###### 29
<span class=verse-first>29</span>When he left there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up a mountain, where he sat down.
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>Then large crowds came to him bringing with them the lame, blind, crippled, mute, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.
###### 31
<span class=verse-body>31</span>As a result, the crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, the lame walking, and the blind seeing, and they praised the God of Israel.
## The Feeding of the Four Thousand
###### 32
<span class=verse-first>32</span>Then Jesus called his disciples and said, “I have compassion on the crowd, because they have already been here with me three days and they have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away hungry since they may faint on the way.”
###### 33
<span class=verse-body>33</span>The disciples said to him, “Where can we get enough bread in this desolate place to satisfy so great a crowd?”
###### 34
<span class=verse-body>34</span>Jesus said to them, “How many loaves do you have?” They replied, “Seven—and a few small fish.”
###### 35
<span class=verse-body>35</span>After instructing the crowd to sit down on the ground,
###### 36
<span class=verse-body>36</span>he took the seven loaves and the fish, and after giving thanks, he broke them and began giving them to the disciples, who then gave them to the crowds.
###### 37
<span class=verse-body>37</span>They all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up the broken pieces left over, seven baskets full.
###### 38
<span class=verse-body>38</span>Not counting children and women, there were 4,000 men who ate.

###### 39
<span class=verse-first>39</span>After sending away the crowd, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
