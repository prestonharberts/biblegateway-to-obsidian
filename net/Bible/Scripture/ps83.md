###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>O God, do not be silent.
>Do not ignore us. Do not be inactive, O God.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>For look, your enemies are making a commotion;
>Those who hate you are hostile.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>They carefully plot against your people,
>And make plans to harm the ones you cherish.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>They say, “Come on, let’s annihilate them so they are no longer a nation.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then the name of Israel will be remembered no more.”
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Yes, they devise a unified strategy;
>They form an alliance against you.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>It includes the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites,
>Moab and the Hagrites,
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek,
>Philistia and the inhabitants of Tyre.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Even Assyria has allied with them,
>Lending its strength to the descendants of Lot. (Selah)
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span>Do to them as you did to Midian—
>As you did to Sisera and Jabin at the Kishon River.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>They were destroyed at Endor;
>Their corpses were like manure on the ground.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,
>And all their rulers like Zebah and Zalmunna,
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Who said, “Let’s take over the pastures of God.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span>O my God, make them like dead thistles,
>Like dead weeds blown away by the wind.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>Like the fire that burns down the forest,
>Or the flames that consume the mountainsides,
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>Chase them with your gale winds,
>And terrify them with your windstorm.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>Cover their faces with shame,
>So they might seek you, O Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>May they be humiliated and continually terrified.
>May they die in shame.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>Then they will know that you alone are the Lᴏʀᴅ,
>The Most High over all the earth.
