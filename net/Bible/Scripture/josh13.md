## The Lord Speaks to Joshua
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>When Joshua was very old, the Lᴏʀᴅ told him, “You are very old, and a great deal of land remains to be conquered.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“This is the land that remains: all the territory of the Philistines and all the Geshurites,
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“from the Shihor River east of Egypt northward to the territory of Ekron (it is regarded as Canaanite territory), including the area belonging to the five Philistine lords who ruled in Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron, as well as Avvite land
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“to the south; all the Canaanite territory, from Arah in the region of Sidon to Aphek, as far as Amorite territory;
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“the territory of Byblos and all Lebanon to the east, from Baal Gad below Mount Hermon to Lebo Hamath.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>“I will drive out before the Israelites all who live in the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim, all the Sidonians; you be sure to parcel it out to Israel as I instructed you.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“Now, divide up this land among the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.”
## Tribal Lands East of the Jordan
###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>The other half of Manasseh, Reuben, and Gad received their allotted tribal lands on east side of the Jordan, just as Moses, the Lᴏʀᴅ’s servant, had assigned them.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>Their territory started from Aroer (on the edge of the Arnon Valley), included the city in the middle of the valley, the whole plain of Medeba as far as Dibon,
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>and all the cities of King Sihon of the Amorites who ruled in Heshbon, and ended at the Ammonite border.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>Their territory also included Gilead, Geshurite and Maacathite territory, all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salecah—
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>the whole kingdom of Og in Bashan, who ruled in Ashtaroth and Edrei. (He was one of the few remaining Rephaites.) Moses defeated them and took their lands.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>But the Israelites did not conquer the Geshurites and Maacathites; Geshur and Maacah live among Israel to this very day.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>However, Moses did not assign land as an inheritance to the Levites; their inheritance is the sacrificial offerings made to the Lᴏʀᴅ God of Israel, as he instructed them.

<span class=verse-body>20</span>Beth Peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth Jeshimoth.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>It encompassed all the cities of the plain and the whole realm of King Sihon of the Amorites who ruled in Heshbon. Moses defeated him and the Midianite leaders Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba (they were subjects of Sihon and lived in his territory).
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>The Israelites killed Balaam son of Beor, the omen reader, along with the others.

###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>It included the valley of Beth Haram, Beth Nimrah, Sukkoth, and Zaphon, and the rest of the realm of King Sihon of Heshbon, the area east of the Jordan to the end of the Sea of Kinnereth.

###### 31
<span class=verse-body>31</span>Half of Gilead, Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities in the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were assigned to the descendants of Makir son of Manasseh, to half the descendants of Makir by their clans.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 32
<span class=verse-first>32</span>These are the land assignments made by Moses in the rift valley plains of Moab east of the Jordan River opposite Jericho.
###### 33
<span class=verse-body>33</span>However, Moses did not assign land as an inheritance to the Levites; their inheritance is the Lᴏʀᴅ God of Israel, as he instructed them.
