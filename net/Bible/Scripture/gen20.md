## Abraham and Abimelech
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Abraham journeyed from there to the Negev region and settled between Kadesh and Shur. While he lived as a temporary resident in Gerar,
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>Abraham said about his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.” So Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent for Sarah and took her.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>But God appeared to Abimelech in a dream at night and said to him, “You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken, for she is someone else’s wife.”
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>Now Abimelech had not gone near her. He said, “Lord, would you really slaughter an innocent nation?
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“Did Abraham not say to me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ I have done this with a clear conscience and with innocent hands!”
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>Then in the dream God replied to him, “Yes, I know that you have done this with a clear conscience. That is why I have kept you from sinning against me and why I did not allow you to touch her.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“But now give back the man’s wife. Indeed he is a prophet and he will pray for you; thus you will live. But if you don’t give her back, know that you will surely die along with all who belong to you.”

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>Early in the morning Abimelech summoned all his servants. When he told them about all these things, they were terrified.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>Abimelech summoned Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us? What sin did I commit against you that would cause you to bring such great guilt on me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should not be done!”
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>Then Abimelech asked Abraham, “What prompted you to do this thing?”
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>Abraham replied, “Because I thought, ‘Surely no one fears God in this place. They will kill me because of my wife.’
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>“What’s more, she is indeed my sister, my father’s daughter, but not my mother’s daughter. She became my wife.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>“When God made me wander from my father’s house, I told her, ‘This is what you can do to show your loyalty to me: Every place we go, say about me, “He is my brother.”’”
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>So Abimelech gave sheep, cattle, and male and female servants to Abraham. He also gave his wife Sarah back to him.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>Then Abimelech said, “Look, my land is before you; live wherever you please.”
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>To Sarah he said, “Look, I have given 1,000 pieces of silver to your ‘brother.’ This is compensation for you so that you will stand vindicated before all who are with you.”
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, as well as his wife and female slaves so that they were able to have children.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ had caused infertility to strike every woman in the household of Abimelech because he took Sarah, Abraham’s wife.
