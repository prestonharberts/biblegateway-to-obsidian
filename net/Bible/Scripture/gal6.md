## Support One Another
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Brothers and sisters, if a person is discovered in some sin, you who are spiritual restore such a person in a spirit of gentleness. Pay close attention to yourselves, so that you are not tempted too.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>Carry one anotherâ€™s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>Let each one examine his own work. Then he can take pride in himself and not compare himself with someone else.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>For each one will carry his own load.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 6
<span class=verse-first>6</span>Now the one who receives instruction in the word must share all good things with the one who teaches it.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>Do not be deceived. God will not be made a fool. For a person will reap what he sows,
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>because the person who sows to his own flesh will reap corruption from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>So we must not grow weary in doing good, for in due time we will reap, if we do not give up.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>So then, whenever we have an opportunity, let us do good to all people, and especially to those who belong to the family of faith.
## Final Instructions and Benediction
###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>See what big letters I make as I write to you with my own hand!
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>Those who want to make a good showing in external matters are trying to force you to be circumcised. They do so only to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>For those who are circumcised do not obey the law themselves, but they want you to be circumcised so that they can boast about your flesh.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>But may I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything; the only thing that matters is a new creation!
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>And all who will behave in accordance with this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on the Israel of God.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
<span class=verse-first>17</span>From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear the marks of Jesus on my body.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers and sisters. Amen.
