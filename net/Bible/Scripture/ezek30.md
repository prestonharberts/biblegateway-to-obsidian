###### 20
<span class=verse-first>20</span>In the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh day of the month, the Lord’s message came to me:
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>“Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt. Look, it has not been bandaged for healing or set with a dressing so that it might become strong enough to grasp a sword.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>“Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says: Look, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and I will break his arms, the strong arm and the broken one, and I will make the sword drop from his hand.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>“I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among foreign countries.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>“I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and I will place my sword in his hand, but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he will groan like the fatally wounded before the king of Babylon.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>“I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, but the arms of Pharaoh will fall limp. Then they will know that I am the Lᴏʀᴅ when I place my sword in the hand of the king of Babylon and he extends it against the land of Egypt.
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>“I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among foreign countries. Then they will know that I am the Lᴏʀᴅ.”
