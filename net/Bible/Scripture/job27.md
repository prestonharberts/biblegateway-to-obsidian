## A Protest of Innocence

###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As surely as God lives, who has denied me justice,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Almighty, who has made my life bitter—
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For while my spirit is still in me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the breath from God is in my nostrils,
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My lips will not speak wickedness,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And my tongue will whisper no deceit.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will never declare that you three are in the right;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Until I die, I will not set aside my integrity!
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will maintain my righteousness
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And never let it go;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My conscience will not reproach me
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For as long as I live.”
## The Condition of the Wicked
###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>May my enemy be like the wicked,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My adversary like the unrighteous.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For what hope does the godless have when he is cut off,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When God takes away his life?
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Does God listen to his cry
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When distress overtakes him?
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will he find delight in the Almighty?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will he call out to God at all times?
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will teach you about the power of God;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>What is on the Almighty’s mind I will not conceal.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If you yourselves have all seen this,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why in the world do you continue this meaningless talk?
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>This is the portion of the wicked man
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Allotted by God,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The inheritance that evildoers receive
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>From the Almighty.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If his children increase—it is for the sword!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His offspring never have enough to eat.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those who survive him are buried by the plague,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And their widows do not mourn for them.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If he piles up silver like dust
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And stores up clothing like mounds of clay,
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>What he stores up a righteous man will wear,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And an innocent man will inherit his silver.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The house he builds is as fragile as a moth’s cocoon,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a hut that a watchman has made.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He goes to bed wealthy, but will do so no more.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When he opens his eyes, it is all gone.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Terrors overwhelm him like a flood;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>At night a whirlwind carries him off.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The east wind carries him away, and he is gone;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It sweeps him out of his place.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It hurls itself against him without pity
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As he flees headlong from its power.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It claps its hands at him in derision
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And hisses him away from his place.
