## Christian Unity and Christ’s Humility
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Therefore, if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort provided by love, any fellowship in the Spirit, any affection or mercy,
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>complete my joy and be of the same mind, by having the same love, being united in spirit, and having one purpose.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>Instead of being motivated by selfish ambition or vanity, each of you should, in humility, be moved to treat one another as more important than yourself.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>Each of you should be concerned not only about your own interests, but about the interests of others as well.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>You should have the same attitude toward one another that Christ Jesus had,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Who though he existed in the form of God
>Did not regard equality with God
>As something to be grasped,
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>But emptied himself
>By taking on the form of a slave,
>By looking like other men,
>And by sharing in human nature.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>He humbled himself,
>By becoming obedient to the point of death
>—even death on a cross!
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>As a result God highly exalted him
>And gave him the name
>That is above every name,
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>So that at the name of Jesus
>Every knee will bow
>—in heaven and on earth and under the earth—
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>And every tongue confess
>That Jesus Christ is Lord
>To the glory of God the Father.
## Lights in the World
###### 12
<span class=verse-first>12</span>So then, my dear friends, just as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence but even more in my absence, continue working out your salvation with awe and reverence,
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>for the one bringing forth in you both the desire and the effort—for the sake of his good pleasure—is God.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
<span class=verse-first>14</span>Do everything without grumbling or arguing,
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>so that you may be blameless and pure, children of God without blemish though you live in a crooked and perverse society, in which you shine as lights in the world
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>by holding on to the word of life so that on the day of Christ I will have a reason to boast that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice together with all of you.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>And in the same way you also should be glad and rejoice together with me.
## Models for Ministry
###### 19
<span class=verse-first>19</span>Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I too may be encouraged by hearing news about you.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>For there is no one here like him who will readily demonstrate his deep concern for you.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>Others are busy with their own concerns, not those of Jesus Christ.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>But you know his qualifications, that like a son working with his father, he served with me in advancing the gospel.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>So I hope to send him as soon as I know more about my situation,
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>though I am confident in the Lord that I too will be coming to see you soon.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>But for now I have considered it necessary to send Epaphroditus to you. For he is my brother, coworker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to me in my need.
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>Indeed, he greatly missed all of you and was distressed because you heard that he had been ill.
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>In fact he became so ill that he nearly died. But God showed mercy to him—and not to him only, but also to me—so that I would not have grief on top of grief.
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you can rejoice and I can be free from anxiety.
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>So welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor people like him,
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>since it was because of the work of Christ that he almost died. He risked his life so that he could make up for your inability to serve me.
