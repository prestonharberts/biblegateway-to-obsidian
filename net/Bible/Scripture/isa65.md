## The Lord Will Distinguish Between Sinners and the Godly
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I made myself available to those who did not ask for me;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I appeared to those who did not look for me.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I said, ‘Here I am! Here I am!’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To a nation that did not invoke my name.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I spread out my hands all day long
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To my rebellious people,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who lived in a way that is morally unacceptable,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And who did what they desired.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>These people continually and blatantly offend me
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As they sacrifice in their sacred orchards
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And burn incense on brick altars.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They sit among the tombs
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And keep watch all night long.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They eat pork,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And broth from unclean sacrificial meat is in their pans.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They say, ‘Keep to yourself!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Don’t get near me, for I am holier than you!’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>These people are like smoke in my nostrils,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a fire that keeps burning all day long.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, I have decreed:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will not keep silent, but will pay them back;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will pay them back exactly what they deserve,
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For your sins and your ancestors’ sins,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because they burned incense on the mountains
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And offended me on the hills,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will punish them in full measure.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When juice is discovered in a cluster of grapes,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Someone says, ‘Don’t destroy it, for it contains juice.’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So I will do for the sake of my servants—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will not destroy everyone.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will bring forth descendants from Jacob,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And from Judah people to take possession of my mountains.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My chosen ones will take possession of the land;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My servants will live there.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Sharon will become a pasture for sheep,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the Valley of Achor a place where cattle graze;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will belong to my people, who seek me.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But as for you who abandon the Lᴏʀᴅ
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And forget about worshiping at my holy mountain,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who prepare a feast for the god called ‘Fortune,’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And fill up wine jugs for the god called ‘Destiny’—
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I predestine you to die by the sword,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All of you will kneel down at the slaughtering block,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because I called to you, and you did not respond;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I spoke and you did not listen.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You did evil before me;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You chose to do what displeases me.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>So this is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, my servants will eat, but you will be hungry.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, my servants will drink, but you will be thirsty.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, my servants will rejoice, but you will be humiliated.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, my servants will shout for joy as happiness fills their hearts.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But you will cry out as sorrow fills your hearts;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will wail because your spirits will be crushed.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your names will live on in the curse formulas of my chosen ones.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ will kill you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But he will give his servants another name.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Whoever pronounces a blessing in the earth
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will do so in the name of the faithful God;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Whoever makes an oath in the earth
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will do so in the name of the faithful God.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For past problems will be forgotten;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will no longer think about them.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
><span class=verse-first-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For look, I am ready to create
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>New heavens and a new earth!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The former ones will not be remembered;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No one will think about them anymore.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But be happy and rejoice forevermore
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Over what I am about to create!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For look, I am ready to create Jerusalem to be a source of joy,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And her people to be a source of happiness.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Jerusalem will bring me joy,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And my people will bring me happiness.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The sound of weeping or cries of sorrow
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will never be heard in her again.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Never again will one of her infants live just a few days
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or an old man die before his time.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, no one will die before the age of one hundred;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Anyone who fails to reach the age of one hundred will be considered cursed.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will build houses and live in them;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No longer will they build a house only to have another live in it,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or plant a vineyard only to have another eat its fruit,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For my people will live as long as trees,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And my chosen ones will enjoy to the fullest what they have produced.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will not work in vain,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or give birth to children that will experience disaster.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ will bless their children
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And their descendants.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Before they even call out, I will respond;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>While they are still speaking, I will hear.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A wolf and a lamb will graze together;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A lion, like an ox, will eat straw,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And a snake’s food will be dirt.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will no longer injure or destroy
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>On my entire royal mountain,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
