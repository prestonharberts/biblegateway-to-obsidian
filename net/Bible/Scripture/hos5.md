## Announcement of Sin and Judgment
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Hear this, you priests!
>Pay attention, you Israelites!
>Listen closely, O king!
>For judgment is about to overtake you.
>For you were like a trap to Mizpah,
>Like a net spread out to catch Tabor.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Those who revolt are knee-deep in slaughter,
>But I will discipline them all.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>I know Ephraim all too well;
>The evil of Israel is not hidden from me.
>For you have engaged in prostitution, O Ephraim;
>Israel has defiled itself.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>Their wicked deeds do not allow them to return to their God;
>For a spirit of idolatry is in them,
>And they do not acknowledge the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>The arrogance of Israel testifies against it;
>Israel and Ephraim will be overthrown because of their iniquity.
>Even Judah will be brought down with them.
## The Futility of Sacrificial Ritual without Moral Obedience
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Although they bring their flocks and herds
>To seek the favor of the Lᴏʀᴅ,
>They will not find him—
>He has withdrawn himself from them!
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>They have committed treason against the Lᴏʀᴅ,
>Because they bore illegitimate children.
>Soon the new moon festival will devour them and their fields.
## The Prophet’s Declaration of Judgment
###### 8
><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span>Blow the ram’s horn in Gibeah!
>Sound the trumpet in Ramah!
>Sound the alarm in Beth Aven;
>Tremble in fear, O Benjamin!
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>Ephraim will be ruined in the day of judgment.
>What I am declaring to the tribes of Israel will certainly take place!
## The Oppressors of the Helpless Will Be Oppressed
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>The princes of Judah are like those who move boundary markers.
>I will pour out my rage on them like a torrential flood.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Ephraim will be oppressed, crushed under judgment,
>Because he was determined to pursue worthless idols.
## The Curse of the Incurable Wound
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>I will be like a moth to Ephraim,
>Like wood rot to the house of Judah.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>When Ephraim saw his sickness
>And Judah saw his wound,
>Then Ephraim turned to Assyria,
>And begged its great king for help.
>But he will not be able to heal you.
>He cannot cure your wound!
## The Lion Will Carry Israel Off Into Exile
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>I will be like a lion to Ephraim,
>Like a young lion to the house of Judah.
>I myself will tear them to pieces,
>Then I will carry them off, and no one will be able to rescue them!
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>Then I will return again to my lair
>Until they have suffered their punishment.
>Then they will seek me;
>In their distress they will earnestly seek me.
