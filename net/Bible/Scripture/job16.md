## Job’s Reply to Eliphaz
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Then Job replied:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have heard many things like these before.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>What miserable comforters are you all!
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will there be an end to your windy words?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or what provokes you that you answer?
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I also could speak like you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If you were in my place;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I could pile up words against you
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I could shake my head at you.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But I would strengthen you with my words;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Comfort from my lips would bring you relief.”
## Abandonment by God and Man
###### 6
><span class=verse-first-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But if I speak, my pain is not relieved,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And if I refrain from speaking,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How much of it goes away?
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Surely now he has worn me out,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You have devastated my entire household.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You have seized me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And it has become a witness;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My leanness has risen up against me
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And testifies against me.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His anger has torn me and persecuted me;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He has gnashed at me with his teeth;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My adversary locks his eyes on me.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>People have opened their mouths against me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They have struck my cheek in scorn;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They unite together against me.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>God abandons me to evil men,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And throws me into the hands of wicked men.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I was in peace, and he has shattered me.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He has seized me by the neck and crushed me.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He has made me his target;
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His archers surround me.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Without pity he pierces my kidneys
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And pours out my gall on the ground.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He breaks through against me, time and time again;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He rushes against me like a warrior.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have sewed sackcloth on my skin,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And buried my horn in the dust;
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My face is reddened because of weeping,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And on my eyelids there is a deep darkness,
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Although there is no violence in my hands
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And my prayer is pure.”
## An Appeal to God as Witness
###### 18
><span class=verse-first-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>O earth, do not cover my blood,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Nor let there be a secret place for my cry.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even now my witness is in heaven;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My advocate is on high.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My intercessor is my friend
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As my eyes pour out tears to God;
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And he contends with God on behalf of man
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As a man pleads for his friend.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the years that lie ahead are few,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And then I will go on the way of no return.
