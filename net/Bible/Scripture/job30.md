## Job’s Present Misery
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But now they mock me, those who are younger than I,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Whose fathers I disdained too much
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To put with my sheep dogs.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Moreover, the strength of their hands—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>What use was it to me?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those whose strength had perished,
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Gaunt with want and hunger,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They would roam the parched land,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>By night a desolate waste.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>By the brush they would gather herbs from the salt marshes,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the root of the broom tree was their food.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They were banished from the community—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>People shouted at them
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As they would shout at thieves—
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So that they had to live
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In the dry stream beds,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In the holes of the ground, and among the rocks.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They brayed like animals among the bushes
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And were huddled together under the nettles.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Sons of senseless and nameless people,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They were driven out of the land with whips.”
## Job’s Indignities
###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And now I have become their taunt song;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have become a byword among them.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They detest me and maintain their distance;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They do not hesitate to spit in my face.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because God has untied my tent cord and afflicted me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>People throw off all restraint in my presence.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>On my right the young rabble rise up;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They drive me from place to place,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And build up siege ramps against me.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They destroy my path;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They succeed in destroying me
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Without anyone assisting them.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They come in as through a wide breach;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Amid the crash they come rolling in.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Terrors are turned loose on me;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They drive away my honor like the wind,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And as a cloud my deliverance has passed away.”
## Job’s Despondency
###### 16
><span class=verse-first-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And now my soul pours itself out within me;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Days of suffering take hold of me.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Night pierces my bones;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My gnawing pains never cease.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>With great power God grasps my clothing;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He binds me like the collar of my tunic.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He has flung me into the mud,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I have come to resemble dust and ashes.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I cry out to you, but you do not answer me;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I stand up, and you only look at me.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You have become cruel to me;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>With the strength of your hand you attack me.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You pick me up on the wind and make me ride on it;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You toss me about in the storm.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I know that you are bringing me to death,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To the meeting place for all the living.”
## The Contrast With the Past
###### 24
><span class=verse-first-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Surely one does not stretch out his hand
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Against a broken man
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When he cries for help in his distress.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Have I not wept for the unfortunate?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Was not my soul grieved for the poor?
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But when I hoped for good, trouble came;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When I expected light, then darkness came.
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My heart is in turmoil unceasingly;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The days of my affliction confront me.
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I go about blackened, but not by the sun;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In the assembly I stand up and cry for help.
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have become a brother to jackals
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And a companion of ostriches.
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My skin has turned dark on me;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My body is hot with fever.
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My harp is used for mourning
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And my flute for the sound of weeping.
