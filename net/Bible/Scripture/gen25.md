## The Death of Abraham
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Abraham had taken another wife, named Keturah.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>Jokshan became the father of Sheba and Dedan. The descendants of Dedan were the Asshurites, Letushites, and Leummites.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>Everything he owned Abraham left to his son Isaac.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>But while he was still alive, Abraham gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them off to the east, away from his son Isaac.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
<span class=verse-first>7</span>Abraham lived a total of 175 years.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, an old man who had lived a full life. He joined his ancestors.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar, the Hittite.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>This was the field Abraham had purchased from the sons of Heth. There Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>After Abraham’s death, God blessed his son Isaac. Isaac lived near Beer Lahai Roi.
## The Sons of Ishmael
###### 12
<span class=verse-first>12</span>This is the account of Abraham’s son Ishmael, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s servant, bore to Abraham.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>These are the names of Ishmael’s sons, by their names according to their records: Nebaioth (Ishmael’s firstborn), Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names by their settlements and their camps—twelve princes according to their clans.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>Ishmael lived a total of 137 years. He breathed his last and died; then he joined his ancestors.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>His descendants settled from Havilah to Shur, which runs next to Egypt all the way to Asshur. They settled away from all their relatives.
## Jacob and Esau
###### 19
<span class=verse-first>19</span>This is the account of Isaac, the son of Abraham.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

Abraham became the father of Isaac.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>When Isaac was forty years old, he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram and sister of Laban the Aramean.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>Isaac prayed to the Lᴏʀᴅ on behalf of his wife because she was childless. The Lᴏʀᴅ answered his prayer, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>But the children struggled inside her, and she said, “Why is this happening to me?” So she asked the Lᴏʀᴅ,
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>and the Lᴏʀᴅ said to her,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Two nations are in your womb,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And two peoples will be separated from within you.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>One people will be stronger than the other,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the older will serve the younger.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>When the time came for Rebekah to give birth, there were twins in her womb.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>The first came out reddish all over, like a hairy garment, so they named him Esau.
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>When his brother came out with his hand clutching Esau’s heel, they named him Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when they were born.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 27
<span class=verse-first>27</span>When the boys grew up, Esau became a skilled hunter, a man of the open fields, but Jacob was an even-tempered man, living in tents.
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>Isaac loved Esau because he had a taste for fresh game, but Rebekah loved Jacob.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 29
<span class=verse-first>29</span>Now Jacob cooked some stew, and when Esau came in from the open fields, he was famished.
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>So Esau said to Jacob, “Feed me some of the red stuff—yes, this red stuff—because I’m starving!” (That is why he was also called Edom.)
###### 31
<span class=verse-body>31</span>But Jacob replied, “First sell me your birthright.”
###### 32
<span class=verse-body>32</span>“Look,” said Esau, “I’m about to die! What use is the birthright to me?”
###### 33
<span class=verse-body>33</span>But Jacob said, “Swear an oath to me now.” So Esau swore an oath to him and sold his birthright to Jacob.
###### 34
<span class=verse-body>34</span>Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and lentil stew; Esau ate and drank, then got up and went out. So Esau despised his birthright.
