###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>When all this was over, the Israelites who were in the cities of Judah went out and smashed the sacred pillars, cut down the Asherah poles, and demolished all the high places and altars throughout Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh. Then all the Israelites returned to their own homes in their cities.
## The People Contribute to the Temple
###### 2
<span class=verse-first>2</span>Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and Levites to do their assigned tasks—to offer burnt sacrifices and present offerings and to serve, give thanks, and offer praise in the gates of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s sanctuary.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>The king contributed some of what he owned for burnt sacrifices, including the morning and evening burnt sacrifices and the burnt sacrifices made on Sabbaths, new moon festivals, and at other appointed times prescribed in the law of the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>He ordered the people living in Jerusalem to contribute the portion prescribed for the priests and Levites so they might be obedient to the law of the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>When the edict was issued, the Israelites freely contributed the initial portion of their grain, wine, olive oil, honey, and all the produce of their fields. They brought a tenth of everything, which added up to a huge amount.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>The Israelites and people of Judah who lived in the cities of Judah also contributed a tenth of their cattle and sheep, as well as a tenth of the holy items consecrated to the Lᴏʀᴅ their God. They brought them and placed them in many heaps.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>In the third month they began piling their contributions in heaps and finished in the seventh month.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>When Hezekiah and the officials came and saw the heaps, they praised the Lᴏʀᴅ and pronounced blessings on his people Israel.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>When Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the heaps,
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>Azariah, the head priest from the family of Zadok, said to him, “Since the contributions began arriving in the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple, we have had plenty to eat and have a large quantity left over. For the Lᴏʀᴅ has blessed his people, and this large amount remains.”

###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>they brought in the contributions, tithes, and consecrated items that had been offered. Konaniah, a Levite, was in charge of all this, assisted by his brother Shimei.

<span class=verse-body>14</span>Kore son of Imnah, a Levite and the guard on the east side, was in charge of the voluntary offerings made to God and disbursed the contributions made to the Lᴏʀᴅ and the consecrated items.

<span class=verse-body>15</span>In the cities of the priests, Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah faithfully assisted him in making disbursements to their fellow priests according to their divisions, regardless of age.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>They made disbursements to all the males three years old and up who were listed in the genealogical records—to all who would enter the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple to serve on a daily basis and fulfill their duties as assigned to their divisions.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>They made disbursements to the priests listed in the genealogical records by their families, and to the Levites twenty years old and up, according to their duties as assigned to their divisions,
###### 18
