## The Lord Will Judge the Earth
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Look, the Lᴏʀᴅ is ready to devastate the earth
>And leave it in ruins;
>He will mar its surface
>And scatter its inhabitants.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Everyone will suffer—the priest as well as the people,
>The master as well as the servant,
>The elegant lady as well as the female attendant,
>The seller as well as the buyer,
>The borrower as well as the lender,
>The creditor as well as the debtor.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>The earth will be completely devastated
>And thoroughly ransacked.
>For the Lᴏʀᴅ has decreed this judgment.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>The earth dries up and withers,
>The world shrivels up and withers;
>The prominent people of the earth fade away.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>The earth is defiled by its inhabitants,
>For they have violated laws,
>Disregarded the regulation,
>And broken the permanent treaty.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>So a treaty curse devours the earth;
>Its inhabitants pay for their guilt.
>This is why the inhabitants of the earth disappear,
>And are reduced to just a handful of people.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span>The new wine dries up,
>The vines shrivel up,
>All those who like to celebrate groan.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>The happy sound of the tambourines stops,
>The revelry of those who celebrate comes to a halt,
>The happy sound of the harp ceases.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>They no longer sing and drink wine;
>The beer tastes bitter to those who drink it.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>The ruined town is shattered;
>All the houses are shut up tight.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>They howl in the streets because of what happened to the wine;
>All joy turns to sorrow;
>Celebrations disappear from the earth.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>The city is left in ruins;
>The gate is reduced to rubble.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>This is what will happen throughout the earth,
>Among the nations.
>It will be like when they beat an olive tree,
>And just a few olives are left at the end of the harvest.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>They lift their voices and shout joyfully;
>They praise the majesty of the Lᴏʀᴅ in the west.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>So in the east extol the Lᴏʀᴅ,
>Along the seacoasts extol the fame of the Lᴏʀᴅ God of Israel.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>From the ends of the earth we hear songs—
>The Just One is majestic.
>But I say, “I’m wasting away! I’m wasting away! I’m doomed!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Deceivers deceive, deceivers thoroughly deceive!”
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>Terror, pit, and snare
>Are ready to overtake, you inhabitants of the earth!
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>The one who runs away from the sound of the terror
>Will fall into the pit;
>The one who climbs out of the pit
>Will be trapped by the snare.
>For the floodgates of the heavens are opened up
>And the foundations of the earth shake.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>The earth is broken in pieces,
>The earth is ripped to shreds,
>The earth shakes violently.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>The earth will stagger around like a drunk;
>It will sway back and forth like a hut in a windstorm.
>Its sin will weigh it down,
>And it will fall and never get up again.
## The Lord Will Become King
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>At that time the Lᴏʀᴅ will punish
>The heavenly forces in the heavens
>And the earthly kings on the earth.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>They will be imprisoned in a pit,
>Locked up in a prison,
>And after staying there for a long time, they will be punished.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span>The full moon will be covered up,
>The bright sun will be darkened;
>For the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies will rule
>On Mount Zion in Jerusalem
>In the presence of his assembly, in majestic splendor.
