## The Lord Desires Genuine Devotion
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Shout loudly! Don’t be quiet!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yell as loudly as a trumpet!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Confront my people with their rebellious deeds;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Confront Jacob’s family with their sin.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They seek me day after day;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They want to know my requirements,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a nation that does what is right
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And does not reject the law of their God.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They ask me for just decrees;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They want to be near God.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They lament, ‘Why don’t you notice when we fast?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why don’t you pay attention when we humble ourselves?’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, at the same time you fast, you satisfy your selfish desires,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You oppress your workers.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, your fasting is accompanied by arguments, brawls,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And fistfights.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not fast as you do today,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Trying to make your voice heard in heaven.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is this really the kind of fasting I want?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do I want a day when people merely humble themselves,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Bowing their heads like a reed
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And stretching out on sackcloth and ashes?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is this really what you call a fast,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A day that is pleasing to the Lᴏʀᴅ?
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No, this is the kind of fast I want:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I want you to remove the sinful chains,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To tear away the ropes of the burdensome yoke,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To set free the oppressed,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And to break every burdensome yoke.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I want you to share your food with the hungry
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And to provide shelter for homeless, oppressed people.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When you see someone naked, clothe them!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Don’t turn your back on your own flesh and blood.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then your light will shine like the sunrise;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your restoration will quickly arrive;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your godly behavior will go before you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the Lᴏʀᴅ’s splendor will be your rear guard.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then you will call out, and the Lᴏʀᴅ will respond;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will cry out, and he will reply, ‘Here I am.’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You must remove the burdensome yoke from among you
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And stop pointing fingers and speaking sinfully.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You must actively help the hungry
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And feed the oppressed.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then your light will dispel the darkness,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And your darkness will be transformed into noonday.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ will continually lead you;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will feed you even in parched regions.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will give you renewed strength,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And you will be like a well-watered garden,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a spring that continually produces water.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your perpetual ruins will be rebuilt;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will reestablish the ancient foundations.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will be called, ‘The one who repairs broken walls,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The one who makes the streets inhabitable again.’

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You must observe the Sabbath
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Rather than doing anything you please on my holy day.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You must look forward to the Sabbath
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And treat the Lᴏʀᴅ’s holy day with respect.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You must treat it with respect by refraining from your normal activities,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And by refraining from your selfish pursuits and from making business deals.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then you will find joy in your relationship to the Lᴏʀᴅ,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I will give you great prosperity,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And cause crops to grow on the land I gave to your ancestor Jacob.”
>Know for certain that the Lᴏʀᴅ has spoken.
