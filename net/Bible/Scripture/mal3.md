###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>“I am about to send my messenger, who will clear the way before me. Indeed, the Lord you are seeking will suddenly come to his temple, and the messenger of the covenant, whom you long for, is certainly coming,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>Who can endure the day of his coming? Who can keep standing when he appears? For he will be like a refiner’s fire, like a launderer’s soap.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>He will act like a refiner and purifier of silver and will cleanse the Levites and refine them like gold and silver. Then they will offer the Lᴏʀᴅ a proper offering.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>The offerings of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the Lᴏʀᴅ as in former times and years past.

###### 5
<span class=verse-first>5</span>“I will come to you in judgment. I will be quick to testify against those who practice divination; those who commit adultery; those who break promises; and those who exploit workers, widows, and orphans, who refuse to help the resident foreigner and in this way show they do not fear me,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies.
## Resistance to the Lord through Selfishness
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>“Since, I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, do not go back on my promises, you, sons of Jacob, have not perished.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
<span class=verse-first>7</span>“From the days of your ancestors you have ignored my commandments and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies. “But you say, ‘How should we return?’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>“Can a person rob God? You are indeed robbing me, but you say, ‘How are we robbing you?’ In tithes and contributions!
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>“You are bound for judgment because you are robbing me—this whole nation is guilty.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“Bring the entire tithe into the storehouse so that there may be food in my temple. Test me in this matter,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies, “to see if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out blessing for you until there is no room for it all.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>“Then I will stop the plague from ruining your crops, and the vine will not lose its fruit before harvest,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>“All nations will call you blessed, for you indeed will live in a delightful land,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies.
## Resistance to the Lord through Self-sufficiency
###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>“You have criticized me sharply,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ, “but you ask, ‘How have we criticized you?’
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>“You have said, ‘It is useless to serve God. How have we been helped by keeping his requirements and going about like mourners before the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies?
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>‘So now we consider the arrogant to be blessed; indeed, those who practice evil are successful. In fact, those who challenge God escape!’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 16
<span class=verse-first>16</span>Then those who respected the Lᴏʀᴅ spoke to one another, and the Lᴏʀᴅ took notice. A scroll was prepared before him in which were recorded the names of those who respected the Lᴏʀᴅ and honored his name.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>“They will belong to me,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies, “in the day when I prepare my own special property. I will spare them as a man spares his son who serves him.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>“Then once more you will see that I make a distinction between the righteous and the wicked, between the one who serves God and the one who does not.
