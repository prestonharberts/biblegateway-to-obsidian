###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>In Jerusalem Jehoshaphat appointed some Levites, priests, and Israelite family leaders to judge on behalf of the Lᴏʀᴅ and to settle disputes among the residents of Jerusalem.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>He commanded them: “Carry out your duties with respect for the Lᴏʀᴅ, with honesty, and with pure motives.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“Whenever your countrymen who live in the cities bring a case before you (whether it involves a violent crime or other matters related to the law, commandments, rules, and regulations), warn them that they must not sin against the Lᴏʀᴅ. If you fail to do so, God will be angry with you and your colleagues, but if you obey, you will be free of guilt.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>“Take note, Amariah the chief priest will oversee you in every matter pertaining to the Lᴏʀᴅ and Zebadiah son of Ishmael, the leader of the family of Judah, in every matter pertaining to the king. The Levites will serve as officials before you. Act courageously, and may the Lᴏʀᴅ be with those who do well!”
