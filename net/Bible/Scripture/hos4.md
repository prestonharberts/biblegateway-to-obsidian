## The Lord’s Covenant Lawsuit against the Nation Israel
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Listen to the Lᴏʀᴅ’s message, you Israelites!
>For the Lᴏʀᴅ has a covenant lawsuit against the people of Israel.
>For there is neither faithfulness nor loyalty in the land,
>Nor do they acknowledge God.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>There is only cursing, lying, murder, stealing, and adultery.
>They resort to violence and bloodshed.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Therefore the land will mourn,
>And all its inhabitants will perish.
>The wild animals, the birds of the sky,
>And even the fish in the sea will perish.
## The Lord’s Dispute against the Sinful Priesthood
###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span>Do not let anyone accuse or contend against anyone else:
>For my case is against you priests!
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>You stumble day and night,
>And the false prophets stumble with you;
>You have destroyed your own people.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>You have destroyed my people
>By failing to acknowledge me!
>Because you refuse to acknowledge me,
>I will reject you as my priests.
>Because you reject the law of your God,
>I will reject your descendants.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span>The more the priests increased in numbers,
>The more they rebelled against me.
>They have turned their glorious calling
>Into a shameful disgrace!
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>They feed on the sin offerings of my people;
>Their appetites long for their iniquity!
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>I will deal with the people and priests together:
>I will punish them both for their ways,
>And I will repay them for their deeds.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>They will eat, but not be satisfied;
>They will engage in prostitution, but not increase in numbers;
>Because they have abandoned the Lᴏʀᴅ
>By pursuing other gods.
## Judgment of Pagan Idolatry and Cultic Prostitution
###### 11
><span class=verse-first-poetry>11</span>Old and new wine
>Take away the understanding of my people.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>They consult their wooden idols,
>And their diviner’s staff answers with an oracle.
>The wind of prostitution blows them astray;
>They commit spiritual adultery against their God.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>They sacrifice on the mountaintops
>And burn offerings on the hills;
>They sacrifice under oak, poplar, and terebinth,
>Because their shade is so pleasant.
>As a result, your daughters have become cult prostitutes,
>And your daughters-in-law commit adultery!
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>I will not punish your daughters when they commit prostitution,
>Nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery.
>For the men consort with harlots,
>They sacrifice with temple prostitutes.
>It is true: “A people that lacks understanding will come to ruin!”
## Warning to Judah: Do Not Join in Israel’s Apostasy
###### 15
><span class=verse-first-poetry>15</span>Although you, O Israel, commit adultery,
>Do not let Judah become guilty!
>Do not journey to Gilgal.
>Do not go up to Beth Aven.
>Do not swear, “As surely as the Lᴏʀᴅ lives!”
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>Israel has rebelled like a stubborn heifer!
>Soon the Lᴏʀᴅ will put them out to pasture
>Like a lamb in a broad field.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>Ephraim has attached himself to idols;
>Do not go near him!
## The Shameful Sinners Will Be Brought to Shame
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>They consume their alcohol,
>Then engage in cult prostitution;
>They dearly love their shameful behavior.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>A whirlwind has wrapped them in its wings;
>They will be brought to shame because of their idolatrous worship.
