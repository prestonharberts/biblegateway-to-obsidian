## Introduction to the Book of Consolation
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ spoke to Jeremiah.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“The Lᴏʀᴅ God of Israel says, ‘Write everything that I am about to tell you in a scroll.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>‘For I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm that the time will come when I will reverse the plight of my people, Israel and Judah,’ says the Lᴏʀᴅ. ‘I will bring them back to the land I gave their ancestors and they will take possession of it once again.’”
## Israel and Judah Will Be Delivered after a Time of Deep Distress
###### 4
<span class=verse-first>4</span>So here is what the Lᴏʀᴅ has to say about Israel and Judah.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 5
<span class=verse-first>5</span>Yes, here is what he says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You hear cries of panic and of terror;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There is no peace in sight.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Ask yourselves this and consider it carefully:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Have you ever seen a man give birth to a baby?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why then do I see all these strong men
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Grabbing their stomachs in pain like a woman giving birth?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And why do their faces
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Turn so deathly pale?
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Alas, what a terrible time of trouble it is!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There has never been any like it.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It is a time of trouble for the descendants of Jacob,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But some of them will be rescued out of it.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When the time for them to be rescued comes,”
>Says the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will rescue you from foreign subjugation.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will deliver you from captivity.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Foreigners will then no longer subjugate them.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But they will be subject to the Lᴏʀᴅ their God
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And to the Davidic ruler whom I will raise up as king over them.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, tell you not to be afraid,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You descendants of Jacob, my servants.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not be terrified, people of Israel.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I will rescue you and your descendants
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>From a faraway land where you are captives.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The descendants of Jacob will return to their land and enjoy peace.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will be secure and no one will terrify them.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm that
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will be with you and will rescue you.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will completely destroy all the nations where I scattered you.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But I will not completely destroy you.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will indeed discipline you, but only in due measure.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will not allow you to go entirely unpunished.”
## The Lord Will Heal the Wounds of Judah
###### 12
<span class=verse-first>12</span>Moreover, the Lᴏʀᴅ says to the people of Zion:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your injuries are incurable;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your wounds are severe.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There is no one to plead your cause.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There are no remedies for your wounds.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There is no healing for you.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All your allies have abandoned you.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They no longer have any concern for you.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I have attacked you like an enemy would.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have chastened you cruelly.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For your wickedness is so great
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And your sin is so much.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why do you complain about your injuries,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That your pain is incurable?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have done all this to you
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because your wickedness is so great
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And your sin is so much.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But all who destroyed you will be destroyed.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All your enemies will go into exile.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those who plundered you will be plundered.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will cause those who pillaged you to be pillaged.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yes, I will restore you to health.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will heal your wounds.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm it!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For you have been called an outcast,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Zion, whom no one cares for.”
## The Lord Will Restore Israel and Judah
###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will restore the ruined houses of the descendants of Jacob.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will show compassion on their ruined homes.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Every city will be rebuilt on its former ruins.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Every fortified dwelling will occupy its traditional site.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Out of those places you will hear songs of thanksgiving
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the sounds of laughter and merriment.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will increase their number and they will not dwindle away.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will bring them honor and they will no longer be despised.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The descendants of Jacob will enjoy their former privileges.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their community will be reestablished in my favor,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I will punish all who try to oppress them.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>One of their own people will be their leader.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their ruler will come from their own number.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will invite him to approach me, and he will do so.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For no one would dare approach me on his own.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm it!
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then you will again be my people,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I will be your God.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 23
><span class=verse-first-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Just watch! The wrath of the Lᴏʀᴅ
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will come like a storm.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a raging storm it will rage down
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>On the heads of those who are wicked.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The anger of the Lᴏʀᴅ will not turn back
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Until he has fully carried out his intended purposes.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In future days you will come to understand this.
