## Salutation
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>From Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our dear friend and colaborer,
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets in your house.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!
## Thanks for Philemon’s Love and Faith
###### 4
<span class=verse-first>4</span>I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers,
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>because I hear of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>I pray that the faith you share with us may deepen your understanding of every blessing that belongs to you in Christ.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>I have had great joy and encouragement because of your love, for the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.
## Paul’s Request for Onesimus
###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>So, although I have quite a lot of confidence in Christ and could command you to do what is proper,
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>I would rather appeal to you on the basis of love—I, Paul, an old man and even now a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus—
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>I am appealing to you concerning my child, whose spiritual father I have become during my imprisonment, that is, Onesimus,
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>who was formerly useless to you, but is now useful to you and me.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>I have sent him (who is my very heart) back to you.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>I wanted to keep him with me so that he could serve me in your place during my imprisonment for the sake of the gospel.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>However, without your consent I did not want to do anything, so that your good deed would not be out of compulsion, but from your own willingness.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>For perhaps it was for this reason that he was separated from you for a little while, so that you would have him back eternally,
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, as a dear brother. He is especially so to me, and even more so to you now, both humanly speaking and in the Lord.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
<span class=verse-first>17</span>Therefore if you regard me as a partner, accept him as you would me.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>Now if he has defrauded you of anything or owes you anything, charge what he owes to me.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>I, Paul, have written this letter with my own hand: I will repay it. I could also mention that you owe me your very self.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>Yes, brother, let me have some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 21
<span class=verse-first>21</span>Since I was confident that you would obey, I wrote to you, because I knew that you would do even more than what I am asking you to do.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 22
<span class=verse-first>22</span>At the same time also, prepare a place for me to stay, for I hope that through your prayers I will be given back to you.
## Concluding Greetings
###### 23
<span class=verse-first>23</span>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my colaborers, greet you too.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 25
<span class=verse-first>25</span>May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
