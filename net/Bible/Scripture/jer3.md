><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Doing that would utterly defile the land.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But you, Israel, have given yourself as a prostitute to many gods.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So what makes you think you can return to me?”

###### 6
<span class=verse-first>6</span>When Josiah was king of Judah, the Lᴏʀᴅ said to me, “Jeremiah, you have no doubt seen what wayward Israel has done. You have seen how she went up to every high hill and under every green tree to give herself like a prostitute to other gods.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“Yet even after she had done all that, I thought that she might come back to me. But she did not. Her sister, unfaithful Judah, saw what she did.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>“She also saw that, because of wayward Israel’s adulterous worship of other gods, I sent her away and gave her divorce papers. But still her unfaithful sister Judah was not afraid, and she too went and gave herself like a prostitute to other gods.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>“Because she took her prostitution so lightly, she defiled the land through her adulterous worship of gods made of wood and stone.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“In spite of all this, Israel’s sister, unfaithful Judah, has not turned back to me with any sincerity; she has only pretended to do so,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>Then the Lᴏʀᴅ said to me, “Under the circumstances, wayward Israel could even be considered less guilty than unfaithful Judah.”
## The Lord Calls on Israel and Judah to Repent
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>“Go and shout this message to my people in the countries in the north. Tell them:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Come back to me, wayward Israel,’ says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will not continue to look on you with displeasure.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For I am merciful,’ says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will not be angry with you forever.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>However, you must confess that you have done wrong
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And that you have rebelled against the Lᴏʀᴅ your God.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You must confess that you have given yourself to foreign gods under every green tree
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And have not obeyed my commands,’ says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>“Come back to me, my wayward sons,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ, “for I am your true master. If you do, I will take one of you from each town and two of you from each family group, and I will bring you back to Zion.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>“I will give you leaders who will be faithful to me. They will lead you with knowledge and insight.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>In those days, your population will greatly increase in the land. At that time,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ, “people will no longer talk about having the ark that contains the Lᴏʀᴅ’s covenant with us. They will not call it to mind, remember it, or miss it. No, that will not be done anymore!
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>“At that time the city of Jerusalem will be called the Lᴏʀᴅ’s throne. All nations will gather there in Jerusalem to honor the Lᴏʀᴅ’s name. They will no longer follow the stubborn inclinations of their own evil hearts.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>“At that time the nation of Judah and the nation of Israel will be reunited. Together they will come back from a land in the north to the land that I gave to your ancestors as a permanent possession.

###### 19
><span class=verse-first-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I thought to myself,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Oh what a joy it would be for me to treat you like a son!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>What a joy it would be for me to give you a pleasant land,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The most beautiful piece of property there is in all the world!’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I thought you would call me ‘Father’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And would never cease being loyal to me.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But, you have been unfaithful to me, nation of Israel,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like an unfaithful wife who has left her husband,”
>Says the Lᴏʀᴅ.

###### 21
><span class=verse-first-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A noise is heard on the hilltops.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It is the sound of the people of Israel crying and pleading to their gods.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed they have followed sinful ways;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They have forgotten to be true to the Lᴏʀᴅ their God.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Come back to me, you wayward people.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I want to cure your waywardness.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Say, ‘Here we are. We come to you
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Because you are the Lᴏʀᴅ our God.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>We know our noisy worship of false gods
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>On the hills and mountains did not help us.

><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Is the only one who can deliver Israel.

###### 24
><span class=verse-first-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>From earliest times our worship of that shameful god, Baal,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Has taken away all that our ancestors worked for.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>It has taken away our flocks and our herds
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And even our sons and daughters.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Let us acknowledge our shame.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Let us bear the disgrace that we deserve.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For we have sinned against the Lᴏʀᴅ our God,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Both we and our ancestors.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>From earliest times to this very day
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>We have not obeyed the Lᴏʀᴅ our God.’
