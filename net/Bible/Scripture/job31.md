## Job Vindicates Himself
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I made a covenant with my eyes;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How then could I entertain thoughts against a virgin?
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>What then would be one’s lot from God above,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>One’s heritage from the Almighty on high?
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is it not misfortune for the unjust,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And disaster for those who work iniquity?
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Does he not see my ways
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And count all my steps?
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 5
><span class=verse-first-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If I have walked in falsehood,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And if my foot has hastened to deceit—
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let him weigh me with honest scales;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then God will discover my integrity.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If my footsteps have strayed from the way,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If my heart has gone after my eyes,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or if anything has defiled my hands,
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then let me sow and let another eat,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And let my crops be uprooted.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If my heart has been enticed by a woman,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I have lain in wait at my neighbor’s door,
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then let my wife turn the millstone for another man,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And may other men commit adultery with her.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I would have committed a shameful act,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>An iniquity to be judged.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For it is a fire that devours even to Destruction,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And it would uproot all my harvest.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If I have disregarded the right of my male servants
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or my female servants
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When they disputed with me,
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then what will I do when God confronts me in judgment;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When he intervenes,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How will I respond to him?
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Did not the one who made me in the womb make them?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Did not the same one form us in the womb?
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 16
><span class=verse-first-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If I have refused to give the poor what they desired,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or caused the eyes of the widow to fail,
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If I ate my morsel of bread myself,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And did not share any of it with orphans—
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But from my youth I raised the orphan like a father,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And from my mother’s womb I guided the widow—
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If I have seen anyone about to perish for lack of clothing,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or a poor man without a coat,
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Whose heart did not bless me
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As he warmed himself with the fleece of my sheep,
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If I have raised my hand to vote against the orphan,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When I saw my support in the court,
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then let my arm fall from the shoulder,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let my arm be broken off at the socket.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the calamity from God was a terror to me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And by reason of his majesty I was powerless.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 24
><span class=verse-first-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If I have put my confidence in gold
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or said to pure gold,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You are my security!’
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If I have rejoiced because of the extent of my wealth,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or because of the great wealth my hand had gained,
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If I looked at the sun when it was shining,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the moon advancing as a precious thing,
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So that my heart was secretly enticed,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And my hand threw them a kiss from my mouth,
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then this also would be iniquity to be judged,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I would have been false to God above.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 29
><span class=verse-first-poetry>29</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If I have rejoiced over the misfortune of my enemy
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or exulted because calamity found him—
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have not even permitted my mouth to sin
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>By asking for his life through a curse—
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If the members of my household have never said,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>If only there were someone
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Who has not been satisfied from Job’s meat!’—
###### 32
><span class=verse-body-poetry>32</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But no stranger had to spend the night outside,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I opened my doors to the traveler—
###### 33
><span class=verse-body-poetry>33</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If I have covered my transgressions as men do,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>By hiding iniquity in my heart,
###### 34
><span class=verse-body-poetry>34</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because I was terrified of the great multitude,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the contempt of families terrified me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So that I remained silent
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And would not go outdoors—”
## Job’s Appeal
###### 35
><span class=verse-body-poetry>35</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If only I had someone to hear me!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Here is my signature—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let the Almighty answer me!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If only I had an indictment
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That my accuser had written.
###### 36
><span class=verse-body-poetry>36</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Surely I would wear it proudly on my shoulder,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I would bind it on me like a crown;
###### 37
><span class=verse-body-poetry>37</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I would give him an accounting of my steps;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a prince I would draw near to him.”
## Job’s Final Solemn Oath
###### 38
><span class=verse-first-poetry>38</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If my land cried out against me
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And all its furrows wept together,
###### 39
><span class=verse-body-poetry>39</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If I have eaten its produce without paying,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or caused the death of its owners,
###### 40
><span class=verse-body-poetry>40</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then let thorns sprout up in place of wheat,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And in place of barley, noxious weeds.”
