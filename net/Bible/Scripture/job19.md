## Job’s Reply to Bildad
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Then Job answered:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How long will you torment me
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And crush me with your words?
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>These ten times you have been reproaching me;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You are not ashamed to attack me.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But even if it were true that I have erred,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My error remains solely my concern!
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And plead my disgrace against me,
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Know then that God has wronged me
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And encircled me with his net.”
## Job’s Abandonment and Affliction
###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If I cry out, ‘Violence!’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I receive no answer;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I cry for help,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But there is no justice.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He has blocked my way so I cannot pass,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And has set darkness over my paths.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He has stripped me of my honor
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And has taken the crown off my head.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He tears me down on every side until I perish;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He uproots my hope like an uprooted tree.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Thus his anger burns against me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And he considers me among his enemies.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His troops advance together;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They throw up a siege ramp against me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And they camp around my tent.”
## Job’s Forsaken State
###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He has put my relatives far from me;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My acquaintances only turn away from me.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My kinsmen have failed me;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My friends have forgotten me.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My guests and my servant girls
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Consider me a stranger;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I am a foreigner in their eyes.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I summon my servant, but he does not respond,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even though I implore him with my own mouth.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My breath is repulsive to my wife;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I am loathsome to my brothers.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even youngsters have scorned me;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When I get up, they scoff at me.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All my closest friends detest me;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And those whom I love have turned against me.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My bones stick to my skin and my flesh;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have escaped alive with only the skin of my teeth.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Have pity on me, my friends, have pity on me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the hand of God has struck me.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why do you pursue me like God does?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will you never be satiated with my flesh?”
## Job’s Assurance of Vindication
###### 23
><span class=verse-first-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>O that my words were written down!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>O that they were written on a scroll!
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>O that with an iron chisel and with lead
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They were engraved in a rock forever!
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As for me, I know that my Redeemer lives,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And that as the last
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will stand upon the earth.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And after my skin has been destroyed,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yet in my flesh I will see God,
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Whom I will see for myself,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And whom my own eyes will behold,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And not another.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My heart grows faint within me.
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If you say, ‘How we will pursue him,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Since the root of the trouble is found in him!’
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Fear the sword yourselves,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For wrath brings the punishment by the sword,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So that you may know
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That there is judgment.”
