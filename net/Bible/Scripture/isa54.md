><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Give a joyful shout and cry out, you who have not been in labor!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the children of the desolate one are more numerous
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Than the children of the married woman,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Make your tent larger,

><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span>Don’t be afraid, for you will not be put to shame.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Don’t be intimidated, for you will not be humiliated.

###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For your husband is the one who made you—

###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, the Lᴏʀᴅ will call you back
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a wife who has been abandoned and suffers from depression,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a young wife when she has been rejected,” says your God.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For a short time I abandoned you,

###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As far as I am concerned, this is like in Noah’s time,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When I vowed that the waters of Noah’s flood would never again cover the earth.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In the same way I have vowed that I will not be angry at you or shout at you.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even if the mountains are removed
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the hills displaced,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My devotion will not be removed from you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Nor will my covenant of friendship be displaced,”
>Says the Lᴏʀᴅ, the one who has compassion on you.

###### 11
><span class=verse-first-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>O afflicted one, driven away, and unconsoled!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, I am about to set your stones in antimony,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And lay your foundation with lapis lazuli.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will make your pinnacles out of gems,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your gates out of beryl,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And your outer wall out of beautiful stones.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All your children will be followers of the Lᴏʀᴅ,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And your children will enjoy great prosperity.

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, you will not be afraid.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will not be terrified,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For nothing frightening will come near you.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If anyone dares to challenge you, it will not be my doing!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Whoever tries to challenge you will be defeated.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, I create the craftsman,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who fans the coals into a fire
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And forges a weapon.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I create the destroyer so he might devastate.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No weapon forged to be used against you will succeed;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will refute everyone who tries to accuse you.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ will do for his servants—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will vindicate them,”
