## Victory at Hormah
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>When the Canaanite king of Arad who lived in the Negev heard that Israel was approaching along the road to Atharim, he fought against Israel and took some of them prisoner.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>So Israel made a vow to the Lᴏʀᴅ and said, “If you will indeed deliver this people into our hand, then we will utterly destroy their cities.”
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ listened to the voice of Israel and delivered up the Canaanites, and they utterly destroyed them and their cities. So the name of the place was called Hormah.
## Fiery Serpents
###### 4
<span class=verse-first>4</span>Then they traveled from Mount Hor by the road to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom, but the people became impatient along the way.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>And the people spoke against God and against Moses, “Why have you brought us up from Egypt to die in the wilderness, for there is no bread or water, and we detest this worthless food.”
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>So the Lᴏʀᴅ sent venomous snakes among the people, and they bit the people; many people of Israel died.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>Then the people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lᴏʀᴅ and against you. Pray to the Lᴏʀᴅ that he would take away the snakes from us.” So Moses prayed for the people.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said to Moses, “Make a poisonous snake and set it on a pole. When anyone who is bitten looks at it, he will live.”
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>So Moses made a bronze snake and put it on a pole, so that if a snake had bitten someone, when he looked at the bronze snake he lived.
## The Approach to Moab
###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>The Israelites traveled on and camped in Oboth.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>Then they traveled on from Oboth and camped at Iye Abarim, in the wilderness that is before Moab on the eastern side.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>From there they moved on and camped in the valley of Zered.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>From there they moved on and camped on the other side of the Arnon, in the wilderness that extends from the regions of the Amorites, for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>This is why it is said in the Book of the Wars of the Lᴏʀᴅ,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Waheb in Suphah and the wadis,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Arnon
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the slope of the valleys
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That extends to the dwelling of Ar,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And falls off at the border of Moab.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 16
<span class=verse-first>16</span>And from there they traveled to Beer; that is the well where the Lᴏʀᴅ spoke to Moses, “Gather the people and I will give them water.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
<span class=verse-first>17</span>Then Israel sang this song:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Spring up, O well, sing to it!
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The well which the princes dug,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Which the leaders of the people opened
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>With their scepters and their staffs.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

And from the wilderness they traveled to Mattanah;
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the country of Moab, near the top of Pisgah, which overlooks the wastelands.
## The Victory over Sihon and Og
###### 21
<span class=verse-first>21</span>Then Israel sent messengers to King Sihon of the Amorites, saying,
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>“Let us pass through your land; we will not turn aside into the fields or into the vineyards, nor will we drink water from any well, but we will go along the King’s Highway until we pass your borders.”
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>But Sihon did not permit Israel to pass through his border; he gathered all his forces together and went out against Israel into the wilderness. When he came to Jahaz, he fought against Israel.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>But the Israelites defeated him in battle and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the Ammonites, for the border of the Ammonites was strongly defended.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>So Israel took all these cities; and Israel settled in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages.
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>For Heshbon was the city of King Sihon of the Amorites. Now he had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken all his land from his control, as far as the Arnon.
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>That is why those who speak in proverbs say,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Come to Heshbon, let it be built.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let the city of Sihon be established!
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For fire went out from Heshbon,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A flame from the city of Sihon.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It has consumed Ar of Moab
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the lords of the high places of Arnon.
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Woe to you, Moab.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You are ruined, O people of Chemosh!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He has made his sons fugitives,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And his daughters the prisoners of King Sihon of the Amorites.
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We have overpowered them;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Heshbon has perished as far as Dibon.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We have shattered them as far as Nophah,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Which reaches to Medeba.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 31
<span class=verse-first>31</span>So the Israelites lived in the land of the Amorites.
###### 32
<span class=verse-body>32</span>Moses sent spies to reconnoiter Jazer, and they captured its villages and dispossessed the Amorites who were there.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 33
<span class=verse-first>33</span>Then they turned and went up by the road to Bashan. And King Og of Bashan and all his forces marched out against them to do battle at Edrei.
###### 34
<span class=verse-body>34</span>And the Lᴏʀᴅ said to Moses, “Do not fear him, for I have delivered him and all his people and his land into your hand. You will do to him what you did to King Sihon of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.”
###### 35
<span class=verse-body>35</span>So they defeated Og, his sons, and all his people, until there were no survivors, and they possessed his land.
