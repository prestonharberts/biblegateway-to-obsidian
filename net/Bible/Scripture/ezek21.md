## The Sword of Judgment
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span> The Lord’s message came to me:
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“Son of man, turn toward Jerusalem and speak out against the sanctuaries. Prophesy against the land of Israel
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“and say to them, ‘This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ says: Look, I am against you. I will draw my sword from its sheath and cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>‘Because I will cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked, my sword will go out from its sheath against everyone from the south to the north.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>‘Then everyone will know that I am the Lᴏʀᴅ, who drew my sword from its sheath—it will not be sheathed again!’
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>“And you, son of man, groan with an aching heart and bitterness; groan before their eyes.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“When they ask you, ‘Why are you groaning?’ you will reply, ‘Because of the report that has come. Every heart will melt with fear and every hand will be limp; everyone will faint, and every knee will be wet with urine.’ Pay attention—it is coming and it will happen, declares the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ.”

<span class=verse-first>8</span>The Lord’s message came to me:
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>“Son of man, prophesy and say: ‘This is what the Lord says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>‘A sword, a sword is sharpened,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And also polished.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>It is sharpened for slaughter,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>It is polished to flash like lightning!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

“‘Should we rejoice in the scepter of my son? No! The sword despises every tree!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He gave it to be polished,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>To be grasped in the hand—
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The sword is sharpened, it is polished—
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Giving it into the hand of the executioner.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Cry out and moan, son of man,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For it is wielded against my people;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Against all the princes of Israel.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They are delivered up to the sword, along with my people.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Therefore, strike your thigh.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>“‘For testing will come, and what will happen when the scepter, which the sword despises, is no more? declares the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ.’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
><span class=verse-first-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And you, son of man, prophesy,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And clap your hands together.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let the sword strike twice, even three times!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It is a sword for slaughter,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A sword for the great slaughter surrounding them.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So hearts melt with fear and many stumble.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>At all their gates I have stationed the sword for slaughter.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Ah! It is made to flash, it is drawn for slaughter!
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Cut sharply on the right!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Swing to the left,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Wherever your edge is appointed to strike.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I too will clap my hands together,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will exhaust my rage;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I the Lᴏʀᴅ have spoken.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span>The Lord’s message came to me:
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>“You, son of man, mark out two routes for the king of Babylon’s sword to take; both of them will originate in a single land. Make a signpost and put it at the beginning of the road leading to the city.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>“Mark out the routes for the sword to take: ‘Rabbah of the Ammonites’ and ‘Judah with Jerusalem in it.’
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>“For the king of Babylon stands at the fork in the road at the head of the two routes. He looks for omens: He shakes arrows, he consults idols, he examines animal livers.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>“Into his right hand comes the portent for Jerusalem—to set up battering rams, to give the signal for slaughter, to shout out the battle cry, to set up battering rams against the gates, to erect a siege ramp, to build a siege wall.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>“But those in Jerusalem will view it as a false omen. They have sworn solemn oaths, but the king of Babylon will accuse them of violations in order to seize them.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 24
<span class=verse-first>24</span>“Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says: ‘Because you have brought up your own guilt by uncovering your transgressions and revealing your sins through all your actions, for this reason you will be taken by force.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>As for you, profane and wicked prince of Israel,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Whose day has come, the time of final punishment,
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>This is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says:
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Tear off the turban;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Take off the crown!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Things must change.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Exalt the lowly;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Bring low the exalted!
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>A total ruin I will make it!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Indeed, this will not be
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Until he comes to whom is the right, and I will give it to him.’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 28
<span class=verse-first>28</span>“As for you, son of man, prophesy and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says concerning the Ammonites and their coming humiliation:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>‘A sword, a sword drawn for slaughter,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Polished to consume, to flash like lightning—
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>While seeing false visions about you
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And reading lying omens about you—
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>To place you on the necks of the profane wicked,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Whose day has come,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The time of final punishment.
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Return it to its sheath!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>In the place where you were created,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>In your native land, I will judge you.
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will pour out my anger on you;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The fire of my fury I will blow on you.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will hand you over to brutal men,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Who are skilled in destruction.
###### 32
><span class=verse-body-poetry>32</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You will become fuel for the fire—
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Your blood will stain the middle of the land;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You will no longer be remembered,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, have spoken.’”
