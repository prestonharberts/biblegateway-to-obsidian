###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Even now they persist in sin!
>They make metal images for themselves,
>Idols that they skillfully fashion from their own silver;
>All of them are nothing but the work of craftsmen.

###### 3

>Like early morning dew that evaporates,

>Like smoke that disappears through an open window.

>As a result, they forgot me!
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>So I will pounce on them like a lion;
>Like a leopard I will lurk by the path.
###### 8

>I will rip open their chests.
>I will devour them there like a lion—
>Like a wild animal would tear them apart.

>Who is there to help you?
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Where then is your king,
>That he may save you in all your cities?
>Where are your rulers for whom you asked, saying,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Give me a king and princes”?
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>I granted you a king in my anger,
>And I will take him away in my wrath!
## Israel’s Punishment Will Not Be Withheld Much Longer

>A scorching east wind will come,
>A wind from the Lᴏʀᴅ rising up from the desert.
>As a result, his spring will dry up;
>His well will become dry.

>In the containers in his storehouse.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span> Samaria will be held guilty,
>Because she rebelled against her God.
>They will fall by the sword;
>Their infants will be dashed to the ground—
>Their pregnant women will be ripped open.
