## The People of Jerusalem Pray
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ, reflect on what has happened to us;
>Consider and look at our disgrace.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Our inheritance is turned over to strangers;
>Foreigners now occupy our homes.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>We have become fatherless orphans;
>Our mothers have become widows.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>We must pay money for our own water;
>We must buy our own wood at a steep price.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>We are pursued—they are breathing down our necks;
>We are weary and have no rest.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>We have submitted to Egypt and Assyria
>In order to buy food to eat.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Our forefathers sinned and are dead,
>But we suffer their punishment.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Slaves rule over us;
>There is no one to rescue us from their power.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>At the risk of our lives we get our food
>Because robbers lurk in the wilderness.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Our skin is as hot as an oven
>Due to a fever from hunger.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>They raped women in Zion,
>Virgins in the towns of Judah.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Princes were hung by their hands;
>Elders were mistreated.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>The young men perform menial labor;
>Boys stagger from their labor.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>The elders are gone from the city gate;
>The young men have stopped playing their music.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>Our hearts no longer have any joy;
>Our dancing is turned to mourning.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>The crown has fallen from our head;
>Woe to us, for we have sinned!
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>Because of this, our hearts are sick;
>Because of these things, we can hardly see through our tears.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>For wild animals are prowling over Mount Zion,
>Which lies desolate.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 19
><span class=verse-first-poetry>19</span>But you, O Lᴏʀᴅ, reign forever;
>Your throne endures from generation to generation.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>Why do you keep on forgetting us?
>Why do you forsake us so long?
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>Bring us back to yourself, O Lᴏʀᴅ, so that we may return to you;
>Renew our life as in days before,
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>Unless you have utterly rejected us
>And are angry with us beyond measure.
