###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>O God, we have clearly heard;
>Our ancestors have told us
>What you did in their days,
>In ancient times.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>You, by your power, defeated nations and settled our fathers on their land;
>You crushed the people living there and enabled our ancestors to occupy it.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>For they did not conquer the land by their swords,
>And they did not prevail by their strength,
>But rather by your power, strength, and good favor,
>For you were partial to them.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span>You are my king, O God.
>Decree Jacob’s deliverance.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>By your power we will drive back our enemies;
>By your strength we will trample down our foes.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>For I do not trust in my bow,
>And I do not prevail by my sword.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>For you deliver us from our enemies;
>You humiliate those who hate us.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>In God we boast all day long,
>And we will continually give thanks to your name. (Selah)
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span>But you rejected and embarrassed us.
>You did not go into battle with our armies.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>You made us retreat from the enemy.
>Those who hate us take whatever they want from us.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>You handed us over like sheep to be eaten;
>You scattered us among the nations.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>You sold your people for a pittance;
>You did not ask a high price for them.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>You made us an object of disdain to our neighbors;
>Those who live on our borders taunt and insult us.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>You made us an object of ridicule among the nations;
>Foreigners treat us with contempt.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>All day long I feel humiliated
>And am overwhelmed with shame,
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>Before the vindictive enemy
>Who ridicules and insults me.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
><span class=verse-first-poetry>17</span>All this has happened to us, even though we have not rejected you
>Or violated your covenant with us.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>We have not been unfaithful,
>Nor have we disobeyed your commands.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>Yet you have battered us, leaving us a heap of ruins overrun by wild dogs;
>You have covered us with darkness.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 20
><span class=verse-first-poetry>20</span>If we had rejected our God,
>And spread out our hands in prayer to another god,
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>Would not God discover it,
>For he knows a person’s secret thoughts?
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>Yet because of you we are killed all day long;
>We are treated like sheep at the slaughtering block.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span>Rouse yourself! Why do you sleep, O Lord?
>Wake up! Do not reject us forever.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span>Why do you look the other way,
>And ignore the way we are oppressed and mistreated?
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span>For we lie in the dirt,
>With our bellies pressed to the ground.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span>Rise up and help us.
>Rescue us because of your loyal love.
