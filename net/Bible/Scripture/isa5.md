## A Love Song Gone Sour
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>I will sing to my love—
>A song to my lover about his vineyard.
>My love had a vineyard
>On a fertile hill.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>He built a hedge around it, removed its stones,
>And planted a vine.
>He built a tower in the middle of it,
>And constructed a winepress.
>He waited for it to produce edible grapes,
>But it produced sour ones instead.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 3
><span class=verse-first-poetry>3</span>So now, residents of Jerusalem,
>People of Judah,
>You decide between me and my vineyard!
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>What more can I do for my vineyard
>Beyond what I have already done?
>When I waited for it to produce edible grapes,
>Why did it produce sour ones instead?
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Now I will inform you
>What I am about to do to my vineyard:
>I will remove its hedge and turn it into pasture,
>I will break its wall and allow animals to graze there.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>I will make it a wasteland;
>No one will prune its vines or hoe its ground,
>And thorns and briers will grow there.
>I will order the clouds
>Not to drop any rain on it.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span>Indeed, Israel is the vineyard of the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies,
>The people of Judah are the cultivated place in which he took delight.
>He waited for justice, but look what he got—disobedience!
>He waited for fairness, but look what he got—cries for help!
## Disaster is Coming
###### 8
><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span>Beware, those who accumulate houses,
>Who also accumulate field after field
>Until there is no land left,
>And you are the only landowners remaining within the land.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies told me this:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Many houses will certainly become desolate,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Large, impressive houses will have no one living in them.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, a large vineyard will produce just a few gallons,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And enough seed to yield several bushels will produce less than a bushel.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
><span class=verse-first-poetry>11</span>Beware, those who get up early to drink beer,
>Those who keep drinking long after dark
>Until they are intoxicated with wine.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>They have stringed instruments, tambourines, flutes,
>And wine at their parties.
>So they do not recognize what the Lᴏʀᴅ is doing,
>They do not perceive what he is bringing about.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span>Therefore my people will be deported
>Because of their lack of understanding.
>Their leaders will have nothing to eat,
>Their masses will have nothing to drink.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>So Death will open up its throat,
>And open wide its mouth;
>Zion’s dignitaries and masses will descend into it,
>Including those who revel and celebrate within her.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>Men will be humiliated,
>They will be brought low;
>The proud will be brought low.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies will be exalted when he punishes,
>The holy God’s authority will be recognized when he judges.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>Lambs will graze as if in their pastures,
>Amid the ruins the rich sojourners will graze.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
><span class=verse-first-poetry>18</span>Beware, those who pull evil along using cords of emptiness are as good as dead,
>Who pull sin as with cart ropes.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>They say, “Let him hurry, let him act quickly,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So we can see;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let the plan of the Holy One of Israel take shape and come to pass,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then we will know it!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 20
><span class=verse-first-poetry>20</span>Beware, those who call evil good and good evil,
>Who turn darkness into light and light into darkness,
>Who turn bitter into sweet and sweet into bitter.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>Beware, those who think they are wise,
>Those who think they possess understanding.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>Beware, those who are champions at drinking,
>Who display great courage when mixing strong drinks.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span>They pronounce the guilty innocent for a payoff,
>They ignore the just cause of the innocent.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 24
><span class=verse-first-poetry>24</span>Therefore, as flaming fire devours straw,
>And dry grass disintegrates in the flames,
>So their root will rot,
>And their flower will blow away like dust.
>For they have rejected the law of the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies,
>They have spurned the commands of the Holy One of Israel.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span>So the Lᴏʀᴅ is furious with his people;
>He lifts his hand and strikes them.
>The mountains shake,
>And corpses lie like manure in the middle of the streets.
>Despite all this, his anger does not subside,
>And his hand is ready to strike again.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 26
><span class=verse-first-poetry>26</span>He lifts a signal flag for a distant nation,
>He whistles for it to come from the far regions of the earth.
>Look, they come quickly and swiftly.
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span>None tire or stumble,
>They don’t stop to nap or sleep.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They don’t loosen their belts,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or unstrap their sandals to rest.
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their arrows are sharpened,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And all their bows are prepared.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The hooves of their horses are hard as flint,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And their chariot wheels are like a windstorm.
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their roar is like a lion’s;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They roar like young lions.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They growl and seize their prey;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They drag it away and no one can come to the rescue.
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>At that time they will growl over their prey,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will sound like sea waves crashing against rocks.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>One will look out over the land and see the darkness of disaster,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Clouds will turn the light into darkness.
