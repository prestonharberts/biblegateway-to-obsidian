## The Opportunity to Begin Again
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>At that same time the Lᴏʀᴅ said to me, “Carve out for yourself two stone tablets like the first ones and come up the mountain to me; also make for yourself a wooden ark.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“I will write on the tablets the same words that were on the first tablets you broke, and you must put them into the ark.”
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>So I made an ark of acacia wood and carved out two stone tablets just like the first ones. Then I went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hands.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ then wrote on the tablets the same words, the Ten Commandments, which he had spoken to you at the mountain from the middle of the fire at the time of that assembly, and he gave them to me.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>Then I turned, went down the mountain, and placed the tablets into the ark I had made—they are still there, just as the Lᴏʀᴅ commanded me.
## Conclusion of the Historical Résumé
###### 6
<span class=verse-first>6</span>During those days the Israelites traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died and was buried, and his son Eleazar became priest in his place.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>From there they traveled to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a place of flowing streams.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>At that time the Lᴏʀᴅ set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s covenant, to stand before the Lᴏʀᴅ to serve him, and to formulate blessings in his name, as they do to this very day.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>Therefore Levi has no allotment or inheritance among his brothers; the Lᴏʀᴅ is his inheritance just as the Lᴏʀᴅ your God told him.

###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>As for me, I stayed at the mountain as I did the first time, forty days and nights. The Lᴏʀᴅ listened to me that time as well and decided not to destroy you.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>Then he said to me, “Get up, set out leading the people so they may go and possess the land I promised to give to their ancestors.”
## An Exhortation to Love Both God and People
###### 12
<span class=verse-first>12</span>Now, Israel, what does the Lᴏʀᴅ your God require of you except to revere him, to obey all his commandments, to love him, to serve him with all your mind and being,
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>and to keep the Lᴏʀᴅ’s commandments and statutes that I am giving you today for your own good?
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>The heavens—indeed the highest heavens—belong to the Lᴏʀᴅ your God, as does the earth and everything in it.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>However, only to your ancestors did he show his loving favor, and he chose you, their descendants, from all peoples—as is apparent today.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>Therefore, cleanse your hearts and stop being so stubborn!
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, mighty, and awesome God who is unbiased and takes no bribe,
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>who justly treats the orphan and widow, and who loves resident foreigners, giving them food and clothing.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>So you must love the resident foreigner because you were foreigners in the land of Egypt.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>Revere the Lᴏʀᴅ your God, serve him, be loyal to him, and take oaths only in his name.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>He is the one you should praise; he is your God, the one who has done these great and awesome things for you that you have seen.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>When your ancestors went down to Egypt, they numbered only seventy, but now the Lᴏʀᴅ your God has made you as numerous as the stars of the sky.
