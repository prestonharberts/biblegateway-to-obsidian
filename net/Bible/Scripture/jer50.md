><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Declare the news! Do not hide it! Say:

###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For a nation from the north will attack Babylon;

###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When that time comes,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The people of Israel and Judah will return to the land together.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will come back with tears of repentance
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As they seek the Lᴏʀᴅ their God.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will ask the way to Zion;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will turn their faces toward it.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will come and bind themselves to the Lᴏʀᴅ
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In a lasting covenant that will never be forgotten.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 6
><span class=verse-first-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My people have been lost sheep.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their shepherds have allowed them to go astray.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They have wandered around in the mountains.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They have roamed from one mountain and hill to another.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They have forgotten their resting place.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All who encountered them devoured them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their enemies who did this said, ‘We are not liable for punishment!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For those people have sinned against the Lᴏʀᴅ, their true pasture.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They have sinned against the Lᴏʀᴅ in whom their ancestors trusted.’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>People of Judah, get out of Babylon quickly!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Leave the land of Babylonia!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Be the first to depart.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Be like the male goats that lead the herd.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I will rouse into action and bring against Babylon
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A host of mighty nations from the land of the north.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will set up their battle lines against her.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will come from the north and capture her.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their arrows will be like a skilled soldier
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who does not return from the battle empty-handed.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Babylonia will be plundered.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those who plunder it will take all they want,”
>Says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
><span class=verse-first-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>People of Babylonia, you plundered my people.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That made you happy and glad.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You frolic about like calves in a pasture.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your joyous sounds are like the neighs of a stallion.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But Babylonia will be put to great shame.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The land where you were born will be disgraced.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, Babylonia will become the least important of all nations.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will become a dry and barren desert.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>After I vent my wrath on it, Babylon will be uninhabited.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will be totally desolate.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All who pass by will be filled with horror and will hiss out their scorn
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because of all the disasters that have happened to it.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Take up your battle positions all around Babylon,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All you soldiers who are armed with bows.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Shoot all your arrows at her! Do not hold any back!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For she has sinned against the Lᴏʀᴅ.

><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Shout the battle cry from all around the city.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>She will throw up her hands in surrender;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Her towers will fall.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Her walls will be torn down.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, am wreaking revenge,

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do to her as she has done!
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Kill all the farmers who sow the seed in the land of Babylon;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Kill all those who wield the sickle at harvest time.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let all the foreigners return to their own people.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let them hurry back to their own lands

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Now, last of all, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon has gnawed their bones.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So I, the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, say:

><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Just as I punished the king of Assyria.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>But I will restore the flock of Israel to their own pasture.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They will graze on Mount Carmel and the land of Bashan.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They will eat until they are full

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Pursue, kill, and completely destroy them!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do just as I have commanded you!
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The noise of battle can be heard in the land of Babylonia.

###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Babylon hammered the whole world to pieces.

###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I set a trap for you, Babylon;

###### 34
><span class=verse-body-poetry>34</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But the one who will rescue them is strong.
