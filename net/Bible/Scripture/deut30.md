###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“Then if you and your descendants turn to the Lᴏʀᴅ your God and obey him with your whole mind and being just as I am commanding you today,
###### 3

## Exhortation to Covenant Obedience
###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>“This commandment I am giving you today is not too difficult for you, nor is it too remote.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>“It is not in heaven, as though one must say, ‘Who will go up to heaven to get it for us and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?’
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>“And it is not across the sea, as though one must say, ‘Who will cross over to the other side of the sea and get it for us and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?’
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>“For the thing is very near you—it is in your mouth and in your mind so that you can do it.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>“Look! I have set before you today life and prosperity on the one hand, and death and disaster on the other.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>“What I am commanding you today is to love the Lᴏʀᴅ your God, to walk in his ways, and to obey his commandments, his statutes, and his ordinances. Then you will live and become numerous and the Lᴏʀᴅ your God will bless you in the land that you are about to possess.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>“However, if you turn aside and do not obey, but are lured away to worship and serve other gods,
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>“I declare to you this very day that you will certainly perish! You will not extend your time in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>“Today I invoke heaven and earth as witnesses against you that I have set life and death, blessing and curse, before you. Therefore choose life so that you and your descendants may live!
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>“I also call on you to love the Lᴏʀᴅ your God, to obey him and be loyal to him, for he gives you life and enables you to live continually in the land the Lᴏʀᴅ promised to give to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”
