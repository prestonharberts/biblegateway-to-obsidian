><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>I have entered my garden, O my sister, my bride;
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

I have gathered my myrrh with my balsam spice.
I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey;
I have drunk my wine and my milk!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

>Eat, friends, and drink!
>Drink freely, O lovers!
