## Lamentation over Pharaoh and Egypt
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first of the month, the Lord’s message came to me:
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“Son of man, sing a lament for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>‘You were like a lion among the nations,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>But you are a monster in the seas;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You thrash about in your streams,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Stir up the water with your feet,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And muddy your streams.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 3
<span class=verse-first>3</span>“‘This is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>‘I will throw my net over you in the assembly of many peoples;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And they will haul you up in my dragnet.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will leave you on the ground,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will fling you on the open field,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will allow all the birds of the sky to settle on you,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And I will permit all the wild animals to gorge themselves on you.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will put your flesh on the mountains,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And fill the valleys with your maggot-infested carcass.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will drench the land with the flow
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Of your blood up to the mountains,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And the ravines will be full of your blood.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>When I extinguish you, I will cover the sky;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will darken its stars.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will cover the sun with a cloud,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And the moon will not shine.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will darken all the lights in the sky over you,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And I will darken your land,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Declares the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will disturb many peoples,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>When I bring about your destruction among the nations,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Among countries you do not know.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will shock many peoples with you,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And their kings will shiver with horror because of you.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>When I brandish my sword before them,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Every moment each one will tremble for his life, on the day of your fall.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>“‘For this is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>‘The sword of the king of Babylon will attack you.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>By the swords of the mighty warriors I will cause your hordes to fall—
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>All of them are the most terrifying among the nations.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They will devastate the pride of Egypt,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And all its hordes will be destroyed.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will destroy all its cattle beside the plentiful waters;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And no human foot will disturb the waters again,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Nor will the hooves of cattle disturb them.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Then I will make their waters calm,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And will make their streams flow like olive oil, declares the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>When I turn the land of Egypt into desolation
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And the land is destitute of everything that fills it,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>When I strike all those who live in it,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Then they will know that I am the Lᴏʀᴅ.’
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>This is a lament; they will chant it.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The daughters of the nations will chant it.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will chant it over Egypt and over all her hordes,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Declares the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ.”

###### 17
<span class=verse-first>17</span>In the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, the Lord’s message came to me:
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>“Son of man, wail over the horde of Egypt. Bring it down; bring her and the daughters of powerful nations down to the lower parts of the earth, along with those who descend to the Pit.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>“Say to them, ‘Whom do you surpass in beauty? Go down and be laid to rest with the uncircumcised!’
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>“They will fall among those killed by the sword. The sword is drawn; they carry her and all her hordes away.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>“The bravest of the warriors will speak to him from the midst of Sheol along with his allies, saying: ‘The uncircumcised have come down; they lie still, killed by the sword.’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 22
<span class=verse-first>22</span>“Assyria is there with all her assembly around her grave, all of them struck down by the sword.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>“Their graves are located in the remote slopes of the Pit. Her assembly is around her grave, all of them struck down by the sword, those who spread terror in the land of the living.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 24
<span class=verse-first>24</span>“Elam is there with all her hordes around her grave; all of them struck down by the sword. They went down uncircumcised to the lower parts of the earth, those who spread terror in the land of the living. Now they will bear their shame with those who descend to the Pit.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>“Among the dead they have made a bed for her, along with all her hordes around her grave. All of them are uncircumcised, killed by the sword, for their terror had spread in the land of the living. They bear their shame along with those who descend to the Pit; they are placed among the dead.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 26
<span class=verse-first>26</span>“Meshech Tubal is there, along with all her hordes around her grave. All of them are uncircumcised, killed by the sword, for they spread their terror in the land of the living.
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>“They do not lie with the fallen warriors of ancient times, who went down to Sheol with their weapons of war, having their swords placed under their heads and their shields on their bones, when the terror of these warriors was in the land of the living.
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>“But as for you, in the midst of the uncircumcised you will be broken, and you will lie with those killed by the sword.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 29
<span class=verse-first>29</span>“Edom is there with her kings and all her princes. Despite their might they are laid with those killed by the sword; they lie with the uncircumcised and those who descend to the Pit.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 30
<span class=verse-first>30</span>“All the leaders of the north are there, along with all the Sidonians; despite their might they have gone down in shameful terror with the dead. They lie uncircumcised with those killed by the sword, and bear their shame with those who descend to the Pit.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 31
<span class=verse-first>31</span>“Pharaoh will see them and be consoled over all his hordes who were killed by the sword, Pharaoh and all his army, declares the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 32
<span class=verse-body>32</span>“Indeed, I terrified him in the land of the living, yet he will lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with those killed by the sword, Pharaoh and all his hordes, declares the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ.”
