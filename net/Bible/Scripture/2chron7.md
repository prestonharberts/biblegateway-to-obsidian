## Solomon Dedicates the Temple
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>When Solomon finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the Lᴏʀᴅ’s splendor filled the temple.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>The priests were unable to enter the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple because the Lᴏʀᴅ’s splendor filled the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>When all the Israelites saw the fire come down and the Lᴏʀᴅ’s splendor over the temple, they got on their knees with their faces downward toward the pavement. They worshiped and gave thanks to the Lᴏʀᴅ, saying, “Certainly he is good; certainly his loyal love endures!”

###### 4
<span class=verse-first>4</span>The king and all the people were presenting sacrifices to the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>King Solomon sacrificed 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep. Then the king and all the people dedicated God’s temple.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>The priests stood in their assigned spots, along with the Levites who had the musical instruments used for praising the Lᴏʀᴅ. (These were the ones King David made for giving thanks to the Lᴏʀᴅ and which were used by David when he offered praise, saying, “Certainly his loyal love endures.”) Opposite the Levites, the priests were blowing the trumpets, while all Israel stood there.

###### 7
<span class=verse-first>7</span>Solomon consecrated the middle of the courtyard that is in front of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple. He offered burnt sacrifices, grain offerings, and the fat from the peace offerings there, because the bronze altar that Solomon had made was too small to hold all these offerings.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>At that time Solomon and all Israel with him celebrated a festival for seven days. This great assembly included people from Lebo Hamath in the north to the Stream of Egypt in the south.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>On the eighth day they held an assembly, for they had dedicated the altar for seven days and celebrated the festival for seven more days.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>On the twenty-third day of the seventh month, Solomon sent the people home. They left happy and contented because of the good the Lᴏʀᴅ had done for David, Solomon, and his people Israel.
## The Lord Gives Solomon a Promise and a Warning
###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>After Solomon finished building the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple and the royal palace and accomplished all his plans for the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple and his royal palace,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 12
<span class=verse-first>12</span>the Lᴏʀᴅ appeared to Solomon at night and said to him: “I have answered your prayer and chosen this place to be my temple where sacrifices are to be made.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>“When I close up the sky so that it doesn’t rain, or command locusts to devour the land’s vegetation, or send a plague among my people,
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>“if my people, who belong to me, humble themselves, pray, seek to please me, and repudiate their sinful practices, then I will respond from heaven, forgive their sin, and heal their land.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>“Now I will be attentive and responsive to the prayers offered in this place.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>“Now I have chosen and consecrated this temple by making it my permanent home; I will be constantly present there.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>“You must serve me as your father David did. Do everything I commanded and obey my rules and regulations.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>“Then I will establish your dynasty, just as I promised your father David, ‘You will not fail to have a successor ruling over Israel.’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 19
<span class=verse-first>19</span>“But if you people ever turn away from me, fail to obey the regulations and rules I instructed you to keep, and decide to serve and worship other gods,
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>“then I will remove you from my land I have given you, I will abandon this temple I have consecrated with my presence, and I will make you an object of mockery and ridicule among all the nations.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>“As for this temple, which was once majestic, everyone who passes by it will be shocked and say, ‘Why did the Lᴏʀᴅ do this to this land and this temple?’
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>“Others will then answer, ‘Because they abandoned the Lᴏʀᴅ God of their ancestors, who led them out of Egypt. They embraced other gods whom they worshiped and served. That is why he brought all this disaster down on them.’”
