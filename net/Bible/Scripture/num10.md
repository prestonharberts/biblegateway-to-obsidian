## The Blowing of Trumpets
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ spoke to Moses:
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“Make two trumpets of silver; you are to make them from a single hammered piece. You will use them for assembling the community and for directing the traveling of the camps.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“When they blow them both, all the community must come to you to the entrance of the tent of meeting.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“But if they blow with one trumpet, then the leaders, the heads of the thousands of Israel, must come to you.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“When you blow an alarm, then the camps that are located on the east side must begin to travel.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>“And when you blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that are located on the south side must begin to travel. An alarm must be sounded for their journeys.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“But when you assemble the community, you must blow the trumpets, but you must not sound an alarm.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>“The sons of Aaron, the priests, must blow the trumpets, and they will be to you for an eternal ordinance throughout your generations.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>“If you go to war in your land against an adversary who opposes you, then you must sound an alarm with the trumpets, and you will be remembered before the Lᴏʀᴅ your God, and you will be saved from your enemies.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“Also, in the time when you rejoice, such as on your appointed festivals or at the beginnings of your months, you must blow with your trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings, so that they may become a memorial for you before your God: I am the Lᴏʀᴅ your God.”
## The Journey From Sinai to Kadesh

###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>These were the traveling arrangements of the Israelites according to their companies when they traveled.
## The Appeal to Hobab
###### 29
<span class=verse-first>29</span>Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel, the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are journeying to the place about which the Lᴏʀᴅ said, ‘I will give it to you.’ Come with us and we will treat you well, for the Lᴏʀᴅ has promised good things for Israel.”
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>But Hobab said to him, “I will not go, but I will go instead to my own land and to my kindred.”
###### 31
<span class=verse-body>31</span>Moses said, “Do not leave us, because you know places for us to camp in the wilderness, and you could be our guide.
###### 32
<span class=verse-body>32</span>“And if you come with us, it is certain that whatever good things the Lᴏʀᴅ will favor us with, we will share with you as well.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 33
<span class=verse-first>33</span>So they traveled from the mountain of the Lᴏʀᴅ three days’ journey; and the ark of the covenant of the Lᴏʀᴅ was traveling before them during the three days’ journey, to find a resting place for them.
###### 34
<span class=verse-body>34</span>And the cloud of the Lᴏʀᴅ was over them by day, when they traveled from the camp.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 35
<span class=verse-first>35</span>And when the ark traveled, Moses would say, “Rise up, O Lᴏʀᴅ! May your enemies be scattered, and may those who hate you flee before you!”
###### 36
<span class=verse-body>36</span>And when it came to rest he would say, “Return, O Lᴏʀᴅ, to the many thousands of Israel!”
