## The Lord Will Judge Ephraim
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>The splendid crown of Ephraim’s drunkards is doomed,
>The withering flower, its beautiful splendor,
>Situated at the head of a rich valley,
>The crown of those overcome with wine.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Look, the Lord sends a strong, powerful one.
>With the force of a hailstorm or a destructive windstorm,
>With the might of a driving, torrential rainstorm,
>He will knock that crown to the ground with his hand.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>The splendid crown of Ephraim’s drunkards
>Will be trampled underfoot.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>The withering flower, its beautiful splendor,
>Situated at the head of a rich valley,
>Will be like an early fig before harvest—
>As soon as someone notices it,
>He grabs it and swallows it.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>At that time the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies will become a beautiful crown
>And a splendid diadem for the remnant of his people.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>He will give discernment to the one who makes judicial decisions,
>And strength to those who defend the city from attackers.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Even these men stagger because of wine;
>They stumble around because of beer—
>Priests and prophets stagger because of beer,
>They are confused because of wine,
>They stumble around because of beer;
>They stagger while seeing prophetic visions,
>They totter while making legal decisions.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Indeed, all the tables
>Are covered with vomit,
>With filth, leaving no clean place.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span>Who is the Lᴏʀᴅ trying to teach?
>To whom is he explaining a message?
>To those just weaned from milk!
>To those just taken from their mother’s breast!
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Indeed, they will hear meaningless gibberish,
>Senseless babbling,
>A syllable here, a syllable there.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>For with mocking lips and a foreign tongue
>He will speak to these people.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>In the past he said to them,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>This is where security can be found.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Provide security for the one who is exhausted.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>This is where rest can be found.”
>But they refused to listen.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>So the Lᴏʀᴅ’s message to them will sound like
>Meaningless gibberish,
>Senseless babbling,
>A syllable here, a syllable there.
>As a result, they will fall on their backsides when they try to walk,
>And be injured, ensnared, and captured.
## The Lord Will Judge Jerusalem
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>Therefore, listen to the Lᴏʀᴅ’s message,
>You who mock,
>You rulers of these people
>Who reside in Jerusalem.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>For you say,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We have made a treaty with death,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>With Sheol we have made an agreement.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When the overwhelming judgment sweeps by
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will not reach us.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For we have made a lie our refuge,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We have hidden ourselves in a deceitful word.”
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ, says:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, I am laying a stone in Zion,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>An approved stone,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Set in place as a precious cornerstone for the foundation.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The one who maintains his faith will not panic.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will make justice the measuring line,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Fairness the plumb line;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Hail will sweep away the unreliable refuge,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The floodwaters will overwhelm the hiding place.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your treaty with death will be dissolved;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your agreement with Sheol will not last.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When the overwhelming judgment sweeps by,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will be overrun by it.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Whenever it sweeps by, it will overtake you;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, every morning it will sweep by,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will come through during the day and the night.”
>When this announcement is understood,
>It will cause nothing but terror.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>For the bed is too short to stretch out on,
>And the blanket is too narrow to wrap around oneself.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ will rise up, as he did at Mount Perazim;
>He will rouse himself, as he did in the Valley of Gibeon,
>To accomplish his work,
>His peculiar work,
>To perform his task,
>His strange task.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>So now, do not mock,
>Or your chains will become heavier!
>For I have heard a message about decreed destruction,
>From the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies against the entire land.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 23
><span class=verse-first-poetry>23</span>Pay attention and listen to my message.
>Be attentive and listen to what I have to say!
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span>Does a farmer just keep on plowing at planting time?
>Does he keep breaking up and harrowing his ground?
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span>Once he has leveled its surface,
>Does he not scatter the seed of the caraway plant,
>Sow the seed of the cumin plant,
>And plant the wheat, barley, and grain in their designated places?
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span>His God instructs him;
>He teaches him the principles of agriculture.
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span>Certainly caraway seed is not threshed with a sledge,
>Nor is the wheel of a cart rolled over cumin seed.
>Certainly caraway seed is beaten with a stick,
>And cumin seed with a flail.
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span>Grain is crushed,
>Though one certainly does not thresh it forever.
>The wheel of one’s wagon rolls over it,
>But his horses do not crush it.
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span>This also comes from the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies,
>Who gives supernatural guidance and imparts great wisdom.
