## Jacob Meets Esau
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Jacob looked up and saw that Esau was coming along with 400 men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two female servants.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>He put the servants and their children in front, with Leah and her children behind them, and Rachel and Joseph behind them.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>But Jacob himself went on ahead of them, and he bowed toward the ground seven times as he approached his brother.

###### 4
<span class=verse-first>4</span>But Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, hugged his neck, and kissed him. Then they both wept.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>When Esau looked up and saw the women and the children, he asked, “Who are these people with you?” Jacob replied, “The children whom God has graciously given your servant.”
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>The female servants came forward with their children and bowed down.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>Then Leah came forward with her children and they bowed down. Finally Joseph and Rachel came forward and bowed down.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>Esau then asked, “What did you intend by sending all these herds to meet me?” Jacob replied, “To find favor in your sight, my lord.”
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>But Esau said, “I have plenty, my brother. Keep what belongs to you.”
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“No, please take them,” Jacob said. “If I have found favor in your sight, accept my gift from my hand. Now that I have seen your face and you have accepted me, it is as if I have seen the face of God.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>“Please take my present that was brought to you, for God has been generous to me and I have all I need.” When Jacob urged him, he took it.

###### 12
<span class=verse-first>12</span>Then Esau said, “Let’s be on our way! I will go in front of you.”
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>But Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are young, and that I have to look after the sheep and cattle that are nursing their young. If they are driven too hard for even a single day, all the animals will die.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>“Let my lord go on ahead of his servant. I will travel more slowly, at the pace of the herds and the children, until I come to my lord at Seir.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>So Esau said, “Let me leave some of my men with you.” “Why do that?” Jacob replied. “My lord has already been kind enough to me.”
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>So that same day Esau made his way back to Seir.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>But Jacob traveled to Sukkoth where he built himself a house and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place was called Sukkoth.

###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span>After he left Paddan Aram, Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem in the land of Canaan, and he camped near the city.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>Then he purchased the portion of the field where he had pitched his tent; he bought it from the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for 100 pieces of money.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>There he set up an altar and called it “The God of Israel is God.”
