## Job’s Reply to Zophar
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Then Job answered:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Listen carefully to my words;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let this be the consolation you offer me.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Bear with me and I will speak,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And after I have spoken you may mock.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is my complaint against a man?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If so, why should I not be impatient?
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look at me and be appalled;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Put your hands over your mouths.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For, when I think about this, I am terrified
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And my body feels a shudder.”
## The Wicked Prosper
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why do the wicked go on living,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Grow old, even increase in power?
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their children are firmly established in their presence,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their offspring before their eyes.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their houses are safe and without fear;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And no rod of punishment from God is upon them.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their bulls breed without fail;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their cows calve and do not miscarry.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They allow their children to run like a flock;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their little ones dance about.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They sing to the accompaniment of tambourine and harp,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And make merry to the sound of the flute.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They live out their years in prosperity
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And go down to the grave in peace.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So they say to God, ‘Turn away from us!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>We do not want to know your ways.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him?
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>What would we gain
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>If we were to pray to him?’
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But their prosperity is not their own doing.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The counsel of the wicked is far from me!”
## How Often Do the Wicked Suffer?
###### 17
><span class=verse-first-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How often is the lamp of the wicked extinguished?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How often does their misfortune come upon them?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How often does God apportion pain to them in his anger?
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How often are they like straw before the wind,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And like chaff swept away by a whirlwind?
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You may say, ‘God stores up a man’s punishment for his children!’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Instead let him repay the man himself
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So that he may be humbled!
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let his own eyes see his destruction;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let him drink of the anger of the Almighty.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For what is his interest in his home
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>After his death,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When the number of his months
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Has been broken off?
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Can anyone teach God knowledge,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Since he judges those that are on high?”
## Death Levels Everything
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>One man dies in his full vigor,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Completely secure and prosperous,
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His body well nourished,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the marrow of his bones moist.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And another man dies in bitterness of soul,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Never having tasted anything good.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Together they lie down in the dust,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And worms cover over them both.”
## Futile Words, Deceptive Answers
###### 27
><span class=verse-first-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yes, I know what you are thinking,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The schemes by which you would wrong me.
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For you say,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Where now is the nobleman’s house,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And where are the tents in which the wicked lived?’
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Have you never questioned those who travel the roads?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do you not recognize their accounts—
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That the evil man is spared
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>From the day of his misfortune,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That he is delivered
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>From the day of God’s wrath?
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No one denounces his conduct to his face;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No one repays him for what he has done.
###### 32
><span class=verse-body-poetry>32</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And when he is carried to the tombs,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And watch is kept over the funeral mound,
###### 33
><span class=verse-body-poetry>33</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The clods of the torrent valley are sweet to him;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Behind him everybody follows in procession,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And before him goes a countless throng.
###### 34
><span class=verse-body-poetry>34</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So how can you console me with your futile words?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Nothing is left of your answers but deception!”
