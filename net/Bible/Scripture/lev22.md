## Regulations for the Eating of Priestly Stipends
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ spoke to Moses:
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“Tell Aaron and his sons that they must deal respectfully with the holy offerings of the Israelites, which they consecrate to me, so that they do not profane my holy name. I am the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“Say to them, ‘Throughout your generations, if any man from all your descendants approaches the holy offerings, which the Israelites consecrate to the Lᴏʀᴅ, while he is impure, that person must be cut off from before me. I am the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>‘No man from the descendants of Aaron who is diseased or has a discharge may eat the holy offerings until he becomes clean. The one who touches anything made unclean by contact with a dead person, or with a man who has a seminal emission,
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>‘or with a man who touches a swarming thing by which he becomes unclean, or who touches a person by which he becomes unclean, whatever that person’s impurity—
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>‘the person who touches any of these will be unclean until evening and must not eat from the holy offerings unless he has bathed his body in water.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>‘When the sun goes down he will be clean, and afterward he may eat from the holy offerings, because they are his food.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>‘He must not eat an animal that has died of natural causes or an animal torn by beasts and thus become unclean by it. I am the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>‘They must keep my charge so that they do not incur sin on account of it and therefore die because they profane it. I am the Lᴏʀᴅ who sanctifies them.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>“‘No lay person may eat anything holy. Neither a priest’s lodger nor a hired laborer may eat anything holy,
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>‘but if a priest buys a person with his own money, that person may eat the holy offerings, and those born in the priest’s own house may eat his food.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>‘If a priest’s daughter marries a lay person, she may not eat the holy contribution offerings,
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>‘but if a priest’s daughter is a widow or divorced, and she has no children so that she returns to live in her father’s house as in her youth, she may eat from her father’s food, but no lay person may eat it.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>“‘If a man eats a holy offering by mistake, he must add one-fifth to it and give the holy offering to the priest.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>‘They must not profane the holy offerings which the Israelites contribute to the Lᴏʀᴅ,
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>‘and so cause them to incur a penalty for guilt when they eat their holy offerings, for I am the Lᴏʀᴅ who sanctifies them.’”
## Regulations for Offering Votive and Freewill Offerings
###### 17
<span class=verse-first>17</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ spoke to Moses:
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>“Speak to Aaron, his sons, and all the Israelites and tell them, ‘When any man from the house of Israel or from the resident foreigners in Israel presents his offering for any of the votive or freewill offerings, which they present to the Lᴏʀᴅ as a burnt offering,
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>‘if it is to be acceptable for your benefit it must be a flawless male from the cattle, sheep, or goats.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>‘You must not present anything that has a flaw, because it will not be acceptable for your benefit.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>‘If a man presents a peace-offering sacrifice to the Lᴏʀᴅ for a special votive offering or for a freewill offering from the herd or the flock, it must be flawless to be acceptable; it must have no flaw.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>“‘You must not present to the Lᴏʀᴅ something blind, or with a broken bone, or mutilated, or with a running sore, or with a festering eruption, or with a feverish rash. You must not give any of these as a gift on the altar to the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>‘As for an ox or a sheep with a limb too long or stunted, you may present it as a freewill offering, but it will not be acceptable for a votive offering.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>‘You must not present to the Lᴏʀᴅ something with testicles that are bruised, crushed, torn, or cut off; you must not do this in your land.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>‘Even from a foreigner you must not present the food of your God from such animals as these, for they are ruined and flawed; they will not be acceptable for your benefit.’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 26
<span class=verse-first>26</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ spoke to Moses:
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>“When an ox, lamb, or goat is born, it must be under the care of its mother seven days, but from the eighth day onward it will be acceptable as an offering gift to the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>“You must not slaughter an ox or a sheep and its young on the same day.
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>“When you sacrifice a thanksgiving offering to the Lᴏʀᴅ, you must sacrifice it so that it is acceptable for your benefit.
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>“On that very day it must be eaten; you must not leave any part of it over until morning. I am the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 31
<span class=verse-body>31</span>“You must be sure to do my commandments. I am the Lᴏʀᴅ.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 32
<span class=verse-first>32</span>“You must not profane my holy name, and I will be sanctified in the midst of the Israelites. I am the Lᴏʀᴅ who sanctifies you,
###### 33
<span class=verse-body>33</span>“the one who brought you out from the land of Egypt to be your God. I am the Lᴏʀᴅ.”
