###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>I love the Lᴏʀᴅ
>Because he heard my plea for mercy,
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>And listened to me.
>As long as I live, I will call to him when I need help.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>The ropes of death tightened around me,
>The snares of Sheol confronted me.
>I was confronted with trouble and sorrow.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>I called on the name of the Lᴏʀᴅ,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Please, Lᴏʀᴅ, rescue my life!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 5
><span class=verse-first-poetry>5</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ is merciful and fair;
>Our God is compassionate.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ protects the untrained;
>I was in serious trouble and he delivered me.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Rest once more, my soul,
>For the Lᴏʀᴅ has vindicated you.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Yes, Lᴏʀᴅ, you rescued my life from death,
>Kept my eyes from tears
>And my feet from stumbling.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>I will serve the Lᴏʀᴅ
>In the land of the living.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>I had faith when I said,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I am severely oppressed.”
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>I rashly declared,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All men are liars.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 12
><span class=verse-first-poetry>12</span>How can I repay the Lᴏʀᴅ
>For all his acts of kindness to me?
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>I will celebrate my deliverance,
>And call on the name of the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>I will fulfill my vows to the Lᴏʀᴅ
>Before all his people.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ values
>The lives of his faithful followers.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>Yes, Lᴏʀᴅ! I am indeed your servant;
>I am your servant, the son of your female servant.
>You saved me from death.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>I will present a thank offering to you,
>And call on the name of the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>I will fulfill my vows to the Lᴏʀᴅ
>Before all his people,
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>In the courts of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple,
>In your midst, O Jerusalem.
>Praise the Lᴏʀᴅ!
