###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ says, “Look! I will make you a weak nation;

###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your presumptuous heart has deceived you—

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Whose home is high in the mountains.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You think to yourself,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>No one can bring me down to the ground!’
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even if you were to soar high like an eagle,

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I can bring you down even from there!” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If thieves came to rob you during the night,

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If grape pickers came to harvest your vineyards,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They would leave some behind for the poor.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But you will be totally destroyed!
###### 6

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your trusted friends will set an ambush for you
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That will take you by surprise!
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>At that time,” the Lᴏʀᴅ says,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will destroy the wise sages of Edom,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The advisers from Esau’s mountain.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your warriors will be shattered, O Teman,

## Edom’s Treachery Against Judah
###### 10
><span class=verse-first-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because you violently slaughtered your relatives, the people of Jacob,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Shame will cover you, and you will be destroyed forever.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You stood aloof while strangers took his army captive,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And foreigners advanced to his gates.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When they cast lots over Jerusalem,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You behaved as though you were in league with them.
