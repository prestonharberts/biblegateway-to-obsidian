## The Prophet Speaks
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Alas! Gold has lost its luster;
>Pure gold loses value.
>Jewels are scattered
>On every street corner.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>The precious sons of Zion
>Were worth their weight in gold—
>Alas!—but now they are treated like broken clay pots,
>Made by a potter.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Even the jackals nurse their young
>At their breast,
>But my people are cruel,
>Like ostriches in the wilderness.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>The infant’s tongue sticks
>To the roof of its mouth due to thirst;
>Little children beg for bread,
>But no one gives them even a morsel.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Those who once feasted on delicacies
>Are now starving to death in the streets.
>Those who grew up wearing expensive clothes
>Are now dying amid garbage.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>The punishment of my people
>Exceeds that of Sodom,
>Which was overthrown in a moment
>With no one to help her.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Our consecrated ones were brighter than snow,
>Whiter than milk;
>Their bodies more ruddy than corals,
>Their hair like lapis lazuli.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Now their appearance is darker than soot;
>They are not recognized in the streets.
>Their skin has shriveled on their bones;
>It is dried up, like tree bark.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>Those who die by the sword are better off
>Than those who die of hunger,
>Those who waste away,
>Struck down from lack of food.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>The hands of tenderhearted women
>Cooked their own children,
>Who became their food,
>When my people were destroyed.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ fully vented his wrath;
>He poured out his fierce anger.
>He started a fire in Zion;
>It consumed her foundations.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Neither the kings of the earth
>Nor the people of the lands ever thought
>That enemy or foe could enter
>The gates of Jerusalem.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>But it happened due to the sins of her prophets
>And the iniquities of her priests,
>Who poured out in her midst
>The blood of the righteous.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>They wander blindly through the streets,
>Defiled by the blood they shed,
>While no one dares
>To touch their garments.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>People cry to them, “Turn away! You are unclean!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Turn away! Turn away! Don’t touch us!”
>So they have fled and wander about;
>But the nations say, “They may not stay here any longer.”
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ himself has scattered them;
>He no longer watches over them.
>They did not honor the priests;
>They did not show favor to the elders.
## The People of Jerusalem Lament
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>Our eyes continually failed us
>As we looked in vain for help.
>From our watchtowers we watched
>For a nation that could not rescue us.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>Our enemies hunted us down at every step
>So that we could not walk about in our streets.
>Our end drew near, our days were numbered,
>For our end had come!
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>Those who pursued us were swifter
>Than eagles in the sky.
>They chased us over the mountains;
>They ambushed us in the wilderness.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>Our very life breath—the Lᴏʀᴅ’s anointed king—
>Was caught in their traps,
>Of whom we thought,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Under his protection we will survive among the nations.”
## The Prophet Speaks
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>Rejoice and be glad for now, O people of Edom,
>Who reside in the land of Uz.
>But the cup of judgment will pass to you also;
>You will get drunk and take off your clothes.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>O people of Zion, your punishment will come to an end;
>He will not prolong your exile.
>But, O people of Edom, he will punish your sin
>And reveal your offenses!
