><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The great prince who watches over your people,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will arise.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There will be a time of distress
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Unlike any other from the nation’s beginning
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Up to that time.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But at that time your own people,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All those whose names are found written in the book,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will escape.

###### 5
<span class=verse-first>5</span>I, Daniel, watched as two others stood there, one on each side of the river.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>One said to the man clothed in linen who was above the waters of the river, “When will the end of these wondrous events occur?”
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>Then I heard the man clothed in linen who was over the waters of the river as he raised both his right and left hands to the sky and made an oath by the one who lives forever: “It is for a time, times, and half a time. Then, when the power of the one who shatters the holy people has been exhausted, all these things will be finished.”
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>I heard, but I did not understand. So I said, “Sir, what will happen after these things?”
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>He said, “Go, Daniel. For these matters are closed and sealed until the time of the end.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“Many will be purified, made clean, and refined, but the wicked will go on being wicked. None of the wicked will understand, though the wise will understand.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>“From the time that the daily sacrifice is removed and the abomination that causes desolation is set in place, there are 1,290 days.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>“Blessed is the one who waits and attains to the 1,335 days.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>“But you should go your way until the end. You will rest and then at the end of the days you will arise to receive what you have been allotted.”
