###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>For look, they wait to ambush me;
>Powerful men stalk me,
>But not because I have rebelled or sinned, O Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>Though I have done nothing wrong, they are anxious to attack.
>Spring into action and help me. Take notice of me.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>You, O Lᴏʀᴅ God of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel,
>Rouse yourself and punish all the nations.

###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>They return in the evening;
>They growl like dogs
>And prowl around outside the city.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Look, they hurl insults at me
>And openly threaten to kill me,
>For they say,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who hears?”
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>But you, O Lᴏʀᴅ, laugh in disgust at them;
>You taunt all the nations.

>God will enable me to triumph over my enemies.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Do not strike them dead suddenly,
>Because then my people might forget the lesson.
>Use your power to make them homeless vagabonds and then bring them down,
>O Lord who shields us.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>They speak sinful words.
>So let them be trapped by their own pride
>And by the curses and lies they speak.

###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>They wander around looking for something to eat;
>They refuse to sleep until they are full.
