## The Lord, not Idols, is the Only Worthy Object of Worship
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>You people of Israel, listen to what the Lᴏʀᴅ has to say to you.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not start following pagan religious practices.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not be in awe of signs that occur in the sky
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even though the nations hold them in awe.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the religion of these people is worthless.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They cut down a tree in the forest,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And a craftsman makes it into an idol with his tools.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He decorates it with overlays of silver and gold.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He uses hammer and nails to fasten it together
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So that it will not fall over.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Such idols are like scarecrows in a cucumber field.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They cannot talk.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They must be carried
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because they cannot walk.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not be afraid of them
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because they cannot hurt you.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And they do not have any power to help you.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 6
<span class=verse-first>6</span>I said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There is no one like you, Lᴏʀᴅ.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You are great,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And you are renowned for your power.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Everyone should revere you, O King of all nations,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because you deserve to be revered.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For there is no one like you
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Among any of the wise people of the nations nor among any of their kings.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The people of those nations are both stupid and foolish.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Instruction from a wooden idol is worthless!
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Hammered-out silver is brought from Tarshish
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And gold is brought from Ufaz to cover those idols.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are the handiwork of carpenters and goldsmiths.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are clothed in blue and purple clothes.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are all made by skillful workers.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ is the only true God.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He is the living God and the everlasting King.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When he shows his anger the earth shakes.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>None of the nations can stand up to his fury.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
><span class=verse-first-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You people of Israel should tell those nations this:
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>These gods did not make heaven and earth.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They will disappear from the earth and from under the heavens.’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 12
><span class=verse-first-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ is the one who by his power made the earth.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He is the one who by his wisdom established the world.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And by his understanding he spread out the skies.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When his voice thunders, the heavenly ocean roars.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He makes the clouds rise from the far-off horizons.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He makes the lightning flash out in the midst of the rain.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He unleashes the wind from the places where he stores it.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All these idolaters will prove to be stupid and ignorant.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Every goldsmith will be disgraced by the idol he made.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the image he forges is merely a sham.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There is no breath in any of those idols.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are worthless, mere objects to be mocked.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When the time comes to punish them, they will be destroyed.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ, who is the inheritance of Jacob’s descendants, is not like them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He is the one who created everything.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the people of Israel are those he claims as his own.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His name is the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies.”
## Jeremiah Laments for and Prays for the People Soon to be Judged
###### 17
><span class=verse-first-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Gather your belongings together and prepare to leave the land,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You people of Jerusalem who are being besieged.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ says, ‘I will now throw out
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Those who live in this land.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will bring so much trouble on them
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>That they will actually feel it.’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 19
><span class=verse-first-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I cried out, ‘We are doomed!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Our wound is severe!’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We once thought, ‘This is only an illness.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And we will be able to bear it.’
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But our tents have been destroyed.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The ropes that held them in place have been ripped apart.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Our children are gone and are not coming back.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There is no survivor to put our tents back up,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No one left to hang their tent curtains in place.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For our leaders are stupid.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They have not sought the Lᴏʀᴅ’s advice.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So they do not act wisely,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the people they are responsible for have all been scattered.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Listen! News is coming even now.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The rumble of a great army is heard approaching from a land in the north.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It is coming to turn the towns of Judah into rubble,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Places where only jackals live.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 23
><span class=verse-first-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Lᴏʀᴅ, we know that people do not control their own destiny.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It is not in their power to determine what will happen to them.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Correct us, Lᴏʀᴅ, but only in due measure.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not punish us in anger or you will reduce us to nothing.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Vent your anger on the nations that do not acknowledge you.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Vent it on the peoples who do not worship you.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For they have destroyed the people of Jacob.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They have completely destroyed them
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And left their homeland in utter ruin.”
