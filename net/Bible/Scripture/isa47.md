><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Sit on the ground, not on a throne,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>O daughter of the Babylonians!

###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I was angry at my people;

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You even placed a very heavy burden on old people.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You said,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will rule forever as permanent queen!’

###### 8
><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So now, listen to this,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>O one who lives so lavishly,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who lives securely,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who says to herself,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I am unique! No one can compare to me!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will never have to live as a widow;

###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Both of these will come upon you
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Suddenly, in one day!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will lose your children and be widowed.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will be overwhelmed by these tragedies,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Despite your many incantations
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And your numerous amulets.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You were complacent in your evil deeds;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You thought, ‘No one sees me.’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your self-professed wisdom and knowledge lead you astray,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When you say, ‘I am unique! No one can compare to me!’
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Disaster will overtake you;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will not know how to charm it away.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Destruction will fall on you;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will not be able to appease it.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Calamity will strike you suddenly,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Before you recognize it.

###### 12
><span class=verse-first-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Persist in trusting your amulets
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And your many incantations,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Which you have faithfully recited since your youth!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Maybe you will be successful—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Maybe you will scare away disaster.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You are tired out from listening to so much advice.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let them take their stand—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The ones who see omens in the sky,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who gaze at the stars,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who make monthly predictions—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let them rescue you from the disaster that is about to overtake you!
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, they are like straw,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That the fire burns up;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They cannot rescue themselves
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>From the heat of the flames.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There are no coals to warm them,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No firelight to enjoy.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will disappoint you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those you have so faithfully dealt with since your youth.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Each strays off in his own direction,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Leaving no one to rescue you.”
