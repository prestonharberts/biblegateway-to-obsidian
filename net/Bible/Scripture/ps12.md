###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Deliver, Lᴏʀᴅ!
>For the godly have disappeared;
>People of integrity have vanished.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>People lie to one another;
>They flatter and deceive.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>May the Lᴏʀᴅ cut off all flattering lips,
>And the tongue that boasts!
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>They say, “We speak persuasively;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We know how to flatter and boast.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who is our master?”
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because of the violence done to the oppressed,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because of the painful cries of the needy,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will spring into action,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will provide the safety they so desperately desire.”

###### 6
><span class=verse-first-poetry>6</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ’s words are absolutely reliable.
>They are as untainted as silver purified in a furnace on the ground,
>Where it is thoroughly refined.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>You, Lᴏʀᴅ, will protect them;
>You will continually shelter each one from these evil people,
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>For the wicked seem to be everywhere,
>When people promote evil.
