## The Parable of the Sower
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Again he began to teach by the lake. Such a large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat on the lake and sat there while the whole crowd was on the shore by the lake.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>He taught them many things in parables, and in his teaching said to them:
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“Listen! A sower went out to sow.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“Other seed fell on rocky ground where it did not have much soil. It sprang up at once because the soil was not deep.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>“When the sun came up it was scorched, and because it did not have sufficient root, it withered.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“Other seed fell among the thorns, and they grew up and choked it, and it did not produce grain.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>“But other seed fell on good soil and produced grain, sprouting and growing; some yielded thirty times as much, some sixty, and some a hundred times.”
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>And he said, “Whoever has ears to hear had better listen!”
## The Purpose of Parables
###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>When he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>He said to them, “The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those outside, everything is in parables,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So that although they look they may look but not see,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And although they hear they may hear but not understand,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So they may not repent and be forgiven.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>He said to them, “Don’t you understand this parable? Then how will you understand any parable?
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>“The sower sows the word.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>“These are the ones on the path where the word is sown: Whenever they hear, immediately Satan comes and snatches the word that was sown in them.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>“These are the ones sown on rocky ground: As soon as they hear the word, they receive it with joy.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>“But they have no root in themselves and do not endure. Then, when trouble or persecution comes because of the word, immediately they fall away.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>“Others are the ones sown among thorns: They are those who hear the word,
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>“but worldly cares, the seductiveness of wealth, and the desire for other things come in and choke the word, and it produces nothing.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>“But these are the ones sown on good soil: They hear the word and receive it and bear fruit, one thirty times as much, one sixty, and one a hundred.”
## The Parable of the Lamp
###### 21
<span class=verse-first>21</span>He also said to them, “A lamp isn’t brought to be put under a basket or under a bed, is it? Isn’t it to be placed on a lampstand?
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>“For nothing is hidden except to be revealed, and nothing concealed except to be brought to light.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>“If anyone has ears to hear, he had better listen!”
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>And he said to them, “Take care about what you hear. The measure you use will be the measure you receive, and more will be added to you.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>“For whoever has will be given more, but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.”
## The Parable of the Growing Seed
###### 26
<span class=verse-first>26</span>He also said, “The kingdom of God is like someone who spreads seed on the ground.
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>“He goes to sleep and gets up, night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>“By itself the soil produces a crop, first the stalk, then the head, then the full grain in the head.
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>“And when the grain is ripe, he sends in the sickle because the harvest has come.”
## The Parable of the Mustard Seed
###### 30
<span class=verse-first>30</span>He also asked, “To what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable can we use to present it?
###### 31
<span class=verse-body>31</span>“It is like a mustard seed that when sown in the ground, even though it is the smallest of all the seeds in the ground—
###### 32
<span class=verse-body>32</span>“when it is sown, it grows up, becomes the greatest of all garden plants, and grows large branches so that the wild birds can nest in its shade.”
## The Use of Parables
###### 33
<span class=verse-first>33</span>So with many parables like these, he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear.
###### 34
<span class=verse-body>34</span>He did not speak to them without a parable. But privately he explained everything to his own disciples.
## Stilling of a Storm
###### 35
<span class=verse-first>35</span>On that day, when evening came, Jesus said to his disciples, “Let’s go across to the other side of the lake.”
###### 36
<span class=verse-body>36</span>So after leaving the crowd, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat, and other boats were with him.
###### 37
<span class=verse-body>37</span>Now a great windstorm developed and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was nearly swamped.
###### 38
<span class=verse-body>38</span>But he was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. They woke him up and said to him, “Teacher, don’t you care that we are about to die?”
###### 39
<span class=verse-body>39</span>So he got up and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Be quiet! Calm down!” Then the wind stopped, and it was dead calm.
###### 40
<span class=verse-body>40</span>And he said to them, “Why are you cowardly? Do you still not have faith?”
###### 41
<span class=verse-body>41</span>They were overwhelmed by fear and said to one another, “Who then is this? Even the wind and sea obey him!”
