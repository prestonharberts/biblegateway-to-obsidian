##### <span class=arrow-left></span>[[eph4|Prev]]<span class=navigation-separator></span>[[eph5notes|Notes]]<span class=navigation-separator></span>[[eph6|Next]]<span class=arrow-right></span>
## Live in Love
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Therefore, be imitators of God as dearly loved children
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>and live in love, just as Christ also loved us and gave himself for us, a sacrificial and fragrant offering to God.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 3
<span class=verse-first>3</span>But among you there must not be either sexual immorality, impurity of any kind, or greed, as these are not fitting for the saints.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>Neither should there be vulgar speech, foolish talk, or coarse jesting—all of which are out of character—but rather thanksgiving.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>For you can be confident of this one thing: that no person who is immoral, impure, or greedy (such a person is an idolater) has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
## Live in the Light
###### 6
<span class=verse-first>6</span>Let nobody deceive you with empty words, for because of these things God’s wrath comes on the sons of disobedience.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>Therefore do not be sharers with them,
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>for you were at one time darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live like children of light—
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth—
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>For the things they do in secret are shameful even to mention.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>But all things being exposed by the light are made visible.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>For everything made visible is light, and for this reason it says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Awake, O sleeper!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Rise from the dead,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And Christ will shine on you!”
## Live Wisely
###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>Therefore consider carefully how you live—not as unwise but as wise,
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>taking advantage of every opportunity, because the days are evil.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>For this reason do not be foolish, but be wise by understanding what the Lord’s will is.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>And do not get drunk with wine, which is debauchery, but be filled by the Spirit,
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making music in your hearts to the Lord,
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>always giving thanks to God the Father for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>and submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.
## Exhortations to Households
###### 22
<span class=verse-first>22</span>Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord,
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>because the husband is the head of the wife as also Christ is the head of the church (he himself being the savior of the body).
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>But as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 25
<span class=verse-first>25</span>Husbands, love your wives just as Christ loved the church and gave himself for her
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>to sanctify her by cleansing her with the washing of the water by the word,
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>so that he may present the church to himself as glorious—not having a stain or wrinkle, or any such blemish, but holy and blameless.
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>In the same way husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>For no one has ever hated his own body, but he feeds it and takes care of it, just as Christ also does the church,
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>because we are members of his body.
###### 31
<span class=verse-body>31</span>For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.
###### 32
<span class=verse-body>32</span>This mystery is great—but I am actually speaking with reference to Christ and the church.
###### 33
<span class=verse-body>33</span>Nevertheless, each one of you must also love his own wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.
