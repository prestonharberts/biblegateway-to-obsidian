###### 3
<span class=verse-first>3</span>Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>who risked their own necks for my life. Not only I, but all the churches of the Gentiles are grateful to them.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>Also greet the church in their house. Greet my dear friend Epenetus, who was the first convert to Christ in the province of Asia.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>Greet Mary, who has worked very hard for you.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>Greet Andronicus and Junia, my compatriots and my fellow prisoners. They are well known to the apostles, and they were in Christ before me.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>Greet Ampliatus, my dear friend in the Lord.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and my good friend Stachys.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>Greet Apelles, who is approved in Christ. Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>Greet Herodion, my compatriot. Greet those in the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord.
###### 12

<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
<span class=verse-first>17</span>Now I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who create dissensions and obstacles contrary to the teaching that you learned. Avoid them!
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>For these are the kind who do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By their smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of the naive.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>Your obedience is known to all and thus I rejoice over you. But I want you to be wise in what is good and innocent in what is evil.

<span class=verse-body>26</span>but now is disclosed, and through the prophetic scriptures has been made known to all the nations, according to the command of the eternal God, to bring about the obedience of faithâ€”
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, be glory forever! Amen.
