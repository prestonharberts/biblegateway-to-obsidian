## The Cutting of the Covenant
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>After these things the Lᴏʀᴅ’s message came to Abram in a vision: “Fear not, Abram! I am your shield and the one who will reward you in great abundance.”
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>But Abram said, “O Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ, what will you give me since I continue to be childless, and my heir is Eliezer of Damascus?”
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>Abram added, “Since you have not given me a descendant, then look, one born in my house will be my heir!”
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>But look, the Lᴏʀᴅ’s message came to him: “This man will not be your heir, but instead a son who comes from your own body will be your heir.”
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ took him outside and said, “Gaze into the sky and count the stars—if you are able to count them!” Then he said to him, “So will your descendants be.”
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>Abram believed the Lᴏʀᴅ, and the Lᴏʀᴅ credited it as righteousness to him.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said to him, “I am the Lᴏʀᴅ who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess.”
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>But Abram said, “O Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ, by what can I know that I am to possess it?”
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said to him, “Take for me a heifer, a goat, and a ram, each three years old, along with a dove and a young pigeon.”
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>So Abram took all these for him and then cut them in two and placed each half opposite the other, but he did not cut the birds in half.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>When birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.

###### 12
<span class=verse-first>12</span>When the sun went down, Abram fell sound asleep, and great terror overwhelmed him.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>Then the Lᴏʀᴅ said to Abram, “Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a foreign country. They will be enslaved and oppressed for 400 years.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>“But I will execute judgment on the nation that they will serve. Afterward they will come out with many possessions.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>“But as for you, you will go to your ancestors in peace and be buried at a good old age.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>“In the fourth generation your descendants will return here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its limit.”

###### 17
<span class=verse-first>17</span>When the sun had gone down and it was dark, a smoking firepot with a flaming torch passed between the animal parts.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>That day the Lᴏʀᴅ made a covenant with Abram: “To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates River—
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>“the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>“Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites,
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>“Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites.”
