## Purification of a Woman after Childbirth
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ spoke to Moses:
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“Tell the Israelites, ‘When a woman produces offspring and bears a male child, she will be unclean seven days, as she is unclean during the days of her menstruation.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>‘On the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin must be circumcised.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>‘Then she will remain thirty-three days in blood purity. She must not touch anything holy and she must not enter the sanctuary until the days of her purification are fulfilled.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>‘If she bears a female child, she will be impure fourteen days as during her menstrual flow, and she will remain sixty-six days in blood purity.

###### 6
<span class=verse-first>6</span>“‘When the days of her purification are completed for a son or for a daughter, she must bring a one-year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or turtledove for a sin offering to the entrance of the Meeting Tent, to the priest.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>‘The priest is to present it before the Lᴏʀᴅ and make atonement on her behalf, and she will be clean from her flow of blood. This is the law of the one who bears a child, for the male or the female child.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>‘If she cannot afford a sheep, then she must take two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a burnt offering and one for a sin offering, and the priest is to make atonement on her behalf, and she will be clean.’”
