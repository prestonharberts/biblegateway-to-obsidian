## The People Have Violated Their Covenant with God
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said to Jeremiah:
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“Hear the terms of the covenant I made with Israel and pass them on to the people of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“Tell them that the Lᴏʀᴅ, the God of Israel, says, ‘Anyone who does not keep the terms of the covenant will be under a curse.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>‘Those are the terms that I charged your ancestors to keep when I brought them out of Egypt, that place that was like an iron-smelting furnace. I said at that time, “Obey me and carry out the terms of the covenant exactly as I commanded you. If you do, you will be my people and I will be your God.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>‘Then I will keep the promise I swore on oath to your ancestors to give them a land flowing with milk and honey.” That is the very land that you still live in today.’” And I responded, “Amen. Let it be so, Lᴏʀᴅ.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 6
<span class=verse-first>6</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said to me, “Announce all the following words in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: ‘Listen to the terms of my covenant with you and carry them out!
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>‘For I solemnly warned your ancestors to obey me. I warned them again and again, ever since I delivered them out of Egypt until this very day.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>‘But they did not listen to me or pay any attention to me! Each one of them followed the stubborn inclinations of his own wicked heart. So I brought on them all the punishments threatened in the covenant because they did not carry out its terms as I commanded them to do.’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
<span class=verse-first>9</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said to me, “The people of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem have plotted rebellion against me.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“They have gone back to the evil ways of their ancestors of old who refused to obey what I told them. They, too, have paid allegiance to other gods and worshiped them. Both the nation of Israel and the nation of Judah have violated the covenant I made with their ancestors.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>“So I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, say this: ‘I will soon bring disaster on them that they will not be able to escape! When they cry out to me for help, I will not listen to them.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>‘Then those living in the towns of Judah and in Jerusalem will go and cry out for help to the gods to whom they have been sacrificing. However, those gods will by no means be able to save them when disaster strikes them.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>‘This is in spite of the fact that the people of Judah have as many gods as they have towns and the citizens of Jerusalem have set up as many altars to sacrifice to that disgusting god, Baal, as they have streets in the city!’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
<span class=verse-first>14</span>“But as for you, Jeremiah, do not pray for these people. Do not raise a cry of prayer for them. For I will not listen to them when they call out to me for help when disaster strikes them.”
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ says to the people of Judah,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>What right do you have to be in my temple, my beloved people?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Many of you have done wicked things.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Can your acts of treachery be so easily canceled by sacred offerings
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That you take joy in doing evil even while you make them?
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, once called you a thriving olive tree,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>One that produced beautiful fruit.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But I will set you on fire,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Fire that will blaze with a mighty roar.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then all your branches will be good for nothing.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For though I, the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies, planted you in the land,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I now decree that disaster will come on you
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because the nations of Israel and Judah have done evil
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And have made me angry by offering sacrifices to the god Baal.”
## A Plot Against Jeremiah is Revealed and He Complains of Injustice
###### 18
><span class=verse-first-poetry>18</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ gave me knowledge, that I might have understanding.
>Then he showed me what the people were doing.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>Before this I had been like a docile lamb ready to be led to the slaughter.
>I did not know they were making plans to kill me.
>I did not know they were saying,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let’s destroy the tree along with its fruit!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let’s remove Jeremiah from the world of the living
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So people will not even be reminded of him anymore.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>So I said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies, you are a just judge!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You examine people’s hearts and minds.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I want to see you pay them back for what they have done
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because I trust you to vindicate my cause.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 21
<span class=verse-first>21</span>Then the Lᴏʀᴅ told me about some men from Anathoth who were threatening to kill me. They had threatened, “Stop prophesying in the name of the Lᴏʀᴅ or we will kill you!”
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>So the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies said, “I will surely punish them! Their young men will be killed in battle. Their sons and daughters will die of starvation.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>“Not one of them will survive. I will bring disaster on those men from Anathoth who threatened you. A day of reckoning is coming for them.”
