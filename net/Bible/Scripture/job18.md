###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How long until you make an end of words?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You must consider, and then we can talk.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why should we be regarded as beasts,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And considered stupid in your sight?
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You who tear yourself to pieces in your anger,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will the earth be abandoned for your sake?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or will a rock be moved from its place?
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 5
><span class=verse-first-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yes, the lamp of the wicked is extinguished;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His flame of fire does not shine.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The light in his tent grows dark;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His lamp above him is extinguished.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His vigorous steps are restricted,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And his own counsel throws him down.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For he has been thrown into a net by his feet
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And he wanders into a mesh.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A trap seizes him by the heel;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A snare grips him.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A rope is hidden for him on the ground
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And a trap for him lies on the path.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Terrors frighten him on all sides
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And dog his every step.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Calamity is hungry for him,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And misfortune is ready at his side.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It eats away parts of his skin;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The most terrible death devours his limbs.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He is dragged from the security of his tent,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And marched off to the king of terrors.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Fire resides in his tent;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Over his residence burning sulfur is scattered.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Below his roots dry up,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And his branches wither above.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His memory perishes from the earth,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He has no name in the land.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He is driven from light into darkness
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And is banished from the world.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He has neither children nor descendants among his people,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No survivor in those places he once stayed.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>People of the west are appalled at his fate;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>People of the east are seized with horror, saying,
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Surely such is the residence of an evil man;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And this is the place of one who has not known God.’”
