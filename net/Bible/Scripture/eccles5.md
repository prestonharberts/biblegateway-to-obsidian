## Rash Vows
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span> Be careful what you do when you go to the temple of God;
>Draw near to listen rather than to offer a sacrifice like fools,
>For they do not realize that they are doing wrong.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span> Do not be rash with your mouth or hasty in your heart to bring up a matter before God,
>For God is in heaven and you are on earth!
>Therefore, let your words be few.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Just as dreams come when there are many cares,
>So the rash vow of a fool occurs when there are many words.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span>When you make a vow to God, do not delay in paying it.
>For God takes no pleasure in fools:
>Pay what you vow!
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>It is better for you not to vow
>Than to vow and not pay it.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Do not let your mouth cause you to sin,
>And do not tell the priest, “It was a mistake!”
>Why make God angry at you
>So that he would destroy the work of your hands?
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Just as there is futility in many dreams,
>So also in many words.
>Therefore, fear God.
## Government Corruption
###### 8
><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span>If you see the extortion of the poor,
>Or the perversion of justice and fairness in the government,
>Do not be astonished by the matter.
>For the high official is watched by a higher official,
>And there are higher ones over them!
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>The produce of the land is seized by all of them,
>Even the king is served by the fields.
## Covetousness
###### 10
><span class=verse-first-poetry>10</span>The one who loves money will never be satisfied with money,
>He who loves wealth will never be satisfied with his income.
>This also is futile.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>When someone’s prosperity increases, those who consume it also increase;
>So what does its owner gain, except that he gets to see it with his eyes?
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>The sleep of the laborer is pleasant—whether he eats little or much—
>But the wealth of the rich will not allow him to sleep.
## Materialism Thwarts Enjoyment of Life
###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span>Here is a misfortune on earth that I have seen:
>Wealth hoarded by its owner to his own misery.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>Then that wealth was lost through bad luck;
>Although he fathered a son, he has nothing left to give him.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>Just as he came forth from his mother’s womb, naked will he return as he came,
>And he will take nothing in his hand that he may carry away from his toil.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>This is another misfortune:
>Just as he came, so will he go.
>What did he gain from toiling for the wind?
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>Surely, he ate in darkness every day of his life,
>And he suffered greatly with sickness and anger.
## Enjoy the Fruit of Your Labor
###### 18
><span class=verse-first-poetry>18</span>I have seen personally what is the only beneficial and appropriate course of action for people:
>To eat and drink, and find enjoyment in all their hard work on earth
>During the few days of their life that God has given them,
>For this is their reward.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>To every man whom God has given wealth and possessions,
>He has also given him the ability
>To eat from them, to receive his reward, and to find enjoyment in his toil;
>These things are the gift of God.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>For he does not think much about the fleeting days of his life
>Because God keeps him preoccupied with the joy he derives from his activity.
