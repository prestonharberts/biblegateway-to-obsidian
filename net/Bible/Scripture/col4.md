###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Masters, treat your slaves with justice and fairness, because you know that you also have a master in heaven.
## Exhortation to Pray for the Success of Paul’s Mission
###### 2
<span class=verse-first>2</span>Be devoted to prayer, keeping alert in it with thanksgiving.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>At the same time pray for us too, that God may open a door for the message so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>Pray that I may make it known as I should.

###### 5
<span class=verse-first>5</span>Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of the opportunities.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you should answer everyone.
## Personal Greetings and Instructions
###### 7
<span class=verse-first>7</span>Tychicus, a dear brother, faithful minister, and fellow slave in the Lord, will tell you all the news about me.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>I sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are doing and that he may encourage your hearts.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>I sent him with Onesimus, the faithful and dear brother, who is one of you. They will tell you about everything here.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends you greetings, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (about whom you received instructions; if he comes to you, welcome him).
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>And Jesus who is called Justus also sends greetings. In terms of Jewish converts, these are the only fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to me.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>Epaphras, who is one of you and a slave of Christ, greets you. He is always struggling in prayer on your behalf, so that you may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>For I can testify that he has worked hard for you and for those in Laodicea and Hierapolis.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>Our dear friend Luke the physician and Demas greet you.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters who are in Laodicea and to Nympha and the church that meets in her house.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>And after you have read this letter, have it read to the church of Laodicea. In turn, read the letter from Laodicea as well.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>And tell Archippus, “See to it that you complete the ministry you received in the Lord.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span>I, Paul, write this greeting by my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you.
