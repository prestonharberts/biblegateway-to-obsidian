## Burning a Useless Vine
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Lord’s message came to me:
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“Son of man, of all the woody branches among the trees of the forest, what happens to the wood of the vine?
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“Can wood be taken from it to make anything useful? Or can anyone make a peg from it to hang things on?
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“No! It is thrown in the fire for fuel; when the fire has burned up both ends of it and it is charred in the middle, will it be useful for anything?
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“Indeed! If it was not made into anything useful when it was whole, how much less can it be made into anything when the fire has burned it up and it is charred?
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>“Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says: Like the wood of the vine is among the trees of the forest that I have provided as fuel for the fire—so I will provide the residents of Jerusalem as fuel.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“I will set my face against them—although they have escaped from the fire, the fire will still consume them! Then you will know that I am the Lᴏʀᴅ, when I set my face against them.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>“I will make the land desolate because they have acted unfaithfully, declares the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ.”
