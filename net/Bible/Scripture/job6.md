## Job Replies to Eliphaz
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Then Job responded:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Oh, if only my grief could be weighed,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And my misfortune laid on the scales too!
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But because it is heavier than the sand of the sea,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That is why my words have been wild.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the arrows of the Almighty are within me;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My spirit drinks their poison;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>God’s sudden terrors are arrayed against me.”
## Complaints Reflect Suffering
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Does the wild donkey bray when it is near grass?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or does the ox bellow over its fodder?
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Can food that is tasteless be eaten without salt?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have refused to touch such things;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are like loathsome food to me.”
## A Cry for Death
###### 8
><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Oh that my request would be realized,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And that God would grant me what I long for!
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And that God would be willing to crush me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That he would let loose his hand
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And kill me.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then I would yet have my comfort,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then I would rejoice,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In spite of pitiless pain,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>What is my strength, that I should wait?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And what is my end,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That I should prolong my life?
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is my strength like that of stones?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or is my flesh made of bronze?
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is not my power to help myself nothing,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And has not every resource been driven from me?”
## Disappointing Friends
###### 14
><span class=verse-first-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To the one in despair, kindness should come from his friend
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even if he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My brothers have been as treacherous as a seasonal stream,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And as the riverbeds of the intermittent streams
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That flow away.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are dark because of ice;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Snow is piled up over them.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When they are scorched, they dry up,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When it is hot, they vanish from their place.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Caravans turn aside from their routes;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They go into the wasteland and perish.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The caravans of Tema looked intently for these streams;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The traveling merchants of Sheba hoped for them.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They were distressed,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because each one had been so confident;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They arrived there, but were disappointed.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For now you have become like these streams that are no help;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You see a terror, and are afraid.”
## Friends’ Fears
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Have I ever said, ‘Give me something,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And from your fortune make gifts in my favor’?
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or, ‘Deliver me from the enemy’s power,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And from the hand of tyrants ransom me’?
## No Sin Discovered
###### 24
><span class=verse-first-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Teach me and I, for my part, will be silent;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Explain to me how I have been mistaken.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How painful are honest words!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But what does your reproof prove?
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do you intend to criticize mere words,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And treat the words of a despairing man as wind?
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yes, you would gamble for the fatherless,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And auction off your friend.”
## Other Explanation
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Now then, be good enough to look at me;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I will not lie to your face!
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Relent, let there be no falsehood;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Reconsider, for my righteousness is intact!
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is there any falsehood on my lips?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Can my mouth not discern evil things?
