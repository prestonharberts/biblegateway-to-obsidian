###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ God who delivers me,
>By day I cry out
>And at night I pray before you.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Listen to my prayer.
>Pay attention to my cry for help.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>For my life is filled with troubles,
>And I am ready to enter Sheol.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>They treat me like those who descend into the grave.
>I am like a helpless man,
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Adrift among the dead,
>Like corpses lying in the grave,
>Whom you remember no more,
>And who are cut off from your power.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>You place me in the lowest regions of the Pit,
>In the dark places, in the watery depths.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Your anger bears down on me,
>And you overwhelm me with all your waves. (Selah)
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>You cause those who know me to keep their distance;
>You make me an appalling sight to them.
>I am trapped and cannot get free.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>My eyes grow weak because of oppression.
>I call out to you, O Lᴏʀᴅ, all day long;
>I spread out my hands in prayer to you.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
><span class=verse-first-poetry>10</span>Do you accomplish amazing things for the dead?
>Do the departed spirits rise up and give you thanks? (Selah)
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Is your loyal love proclaimed in the grave,
>Or your faithfulness in the place of the dead?
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Are your amazing deeds experienced in the dark region,
>Or your deliverance in the land of oblivion?
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span>As for me, I cry out to you, O Lᴏʀᴅ;
>In the morning my prayer confronts you.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ, why do you reject me,
>And pay no attention to me?
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>I am oppressed and have been on the verge of death since my youth.
>I have been subjected to your horrors and am numb with pain.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>Your anger overwhelms me;
>Your terrors destroy me.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>They surround me like water all day long;
>They join forces and encircle me.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>You cause my friends and neighbors to keep their distance;
>Those who know me leave me alone in the darkness.
