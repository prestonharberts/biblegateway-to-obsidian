###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ says, “When that time comes, the bones of the kings of Judah and its leaders, the bones of the priests and prophets, and of all the other people who lived in Jerusalem will be dug up from their graves.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“They will be spread out and exposed to the sun, the moon, and the stars. These are things they adored and served, things to which they paid allegiance, from which they sought guidance and worshiped. The bones of these people will never be regathered and reburied. They will be like manure used to fertilize the ground.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“However, I will leave some of these wicked people alive and banish them to other places. But wherever these people who survive may go, they will wish they had died rather than lived,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies.
## Willful Disregard of God Will Lead to Destruction
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said to me,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Tell them, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ says,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Do people not get back up when they fall down?
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Do they not turn around when they go the wrong way?
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Why, then, do these people of Jerusalem
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Continually turn away from me in apostasy?
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They hold fast to their deception.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They refuse to turn back to me.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I have listened to them very carefully,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>But they do not speak honestly.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>None of them regrets the evil he has done.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>None of them says, “I have done wrong!”
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>All of them persist in their own wayward course
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Like a horse charging recklessly into battle.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Even the stork knows
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>When it is time to move on.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The turtledove, swallow, and crane
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Recognize the normal times for their migration.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>But my people pay no attention
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>To what I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, require of them.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>How can you say, “We are wise!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>We have the law of the Lᴏʀᴅ”?
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The truth is, those who teach it have used their writings
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>To make it say what it does not really mean.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Your wise men will be put to shame.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They will be dumbfounded and be brought to judgment.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Since they have rejected the Lᴏʀᴅ’s message,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>What wisdom do they really have?
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>So I will give their wives to other men
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And their fields to new owners.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For from the least important to the most important of them,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>All of them are greedy for dishonest gain.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Prophets and priests alike
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>All practice deceit.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They offer only superficial help
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For the hurt my dear people have suffered.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They say, “Everything will be all right!”
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>But everything is not all right.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Are they ashamed because they have done such disgusting things?
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>No, they are not at all ashamed!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They do not even know how to blush.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>So they will die just like others have died.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They will be brought to ruin when I punish them,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will take away their harvests, says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>There will be no grapes on their vines.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>There will be no figs on their fig trees.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Even the leaves on their trees will wither.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The crops that I gave them will be taken away.’”
## Jeremiah Laments over the Coming Destruction
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>The people say,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why are we just sitting here?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let us gather together inside the fortified cities.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let us at least die there fighting,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Since the Lᴏʀᴅ our God has condemned us to die.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He has condemned us to drink the poison waters of judgment
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because we have sinned against him.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We hoped for good fortune, but nothing good has come of it.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We hoped for a time of relief, but instead we experience terror.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The snorting of the enemy’s horses
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is already being heard in the city of Dan.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The sound of the neighing of their stallions
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Causes the whole land to tremble with fear.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are coming to destroy the land and everything in it.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are coming to destroy the cities and everyone who lives in them.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ says,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yes indeed, I am sending an enemy against you
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That will be like poisonous snakes that cannot be charmed away.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And they will inflict fatal wounds on you.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span>Then I said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There is no cure for my grief!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I am sick at heart!
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I hear my dear people crying out
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Throughout the length and breadth of the land.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are crying, ‘Is the Lᴏʀᴅ no longer in Zion?
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Is her divine King no longer there?’”
>The Lᴏʀᴅ answers,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why then do they provoke me to anger with their images,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>With their worthless foreign idols?
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They cry, ‘Harvest time has come and gone and the summer is over,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And still we have not been delivered.’
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My heart is crushed because my dear people are being crushed.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I go about crying and grieving. I am overwhelmed with dismay.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There is still medicinal ointment available in Gilead!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There is still a physician there!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why then have my dear people
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Not been restored to health?
