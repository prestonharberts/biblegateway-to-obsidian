## Egypt Will Disappoint
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Those who go down to Egypt for help are as good as dead;
>Those who rely on war horses,
>And trust in Egypt’s many chariots
>And in their many, many horsemen.
>But they do not rely on the Holy One of Israel
>And do not seek help from the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Yet he too is wise and he will bring disaster;
>He does not retract his decree.
>He will attack the wicked nation,
>And the nation that helps those who commit sin.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>The Egyptians are mere humans, not God;
>Their horses are made of flesh, not spirit.
>The Lᴏʀᴅ will strike with his hand;
>The one who helps will stumble
>And the one being helped will fall.
>Together they will perish.
## The Lord Will Defend Zion
###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span>Indeed, this is what the Lᴏʀᴅ has said to me:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ will be like a growling lion,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a young lion growling over its prey.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Though a whole group of shepherds gathers against it,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It is not afraid of their shouts
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or intimidated by their yelling.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In this same way the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies will descend
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To do battle on Mount Zion and on its hill.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Just as birds hover over a nest,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies will protect Jerusalem.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will protect and deliver it;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As he passes over he will rescue it.”

###### 6
<span class=verse-first>6</span>You Israelites! Return to the one you have so blatantly rebelled against!
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>For at that time every one will get rid of the silver and gold idols your hands sinfully made.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Assyria will fall by a sword, but not one human-made;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A sword not made by humankind will destroy them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will run away from this sword
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And their young men will be forced to do hard labor.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will surrender their stronghold because of fear;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their officers will be afraid of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s battle flag.”
>This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ says—
>The one whose fire is in Zion,
>Whose firepot is in Jerusalem.
