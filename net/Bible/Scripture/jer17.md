###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The sin of Judah is engraved with an iron chisel
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>On their stone-hard hearts.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It is inscribed with a diamond point
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>On the horns of their altars.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their children are always thinking about their altars
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And their sacred poles dedicated to the goddess Asherah,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Set up beside the green trees on the high hills
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And on the mountains and in the fields.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will give your wealth and all your treasures away as plunder.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will give it away as the price for the sins you have committed throughout your land.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will lose your hold on the land
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That I gave to you as a permanent possession.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will make you serve your enemies in a land that you know nothing about.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For you have made my anger burn like a fire that will never be put out.”
## Individuals Are Challenged to Put Their Trust in the Lord
###### 5
<span class=verse-first>5</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ says,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will put a curse on people
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who trust in mere human beings,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who depend on mere flesh and blood for their strength,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And whose hearts have turned away from the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will be like a shrub in the arid rift valley.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will not experience good things even when they happen.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will be as though they were growing in the stony wastes in the wilderness,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In a salt land where no one can live.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My blessing is on those people who trust in me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who put their confidence in me.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will be like a tree planted near a stream
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Whose roots spread out toward the water.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It has nothing to fear when the heat comes.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Its leaves are always green.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It has no need to be concerned in a year of drought.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It does not stop bearing fruit.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The human mind is more deceitful than anything else.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It is incurably bad. Who can understand it?
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, probe into people’s minds.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I examine people’s hearts.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I deal with each person according to how he has behaved.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I give them what they deserve based on what they have done.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The person who gathers wealth by unjust means
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is like the partridge that broods over eggs but does not hatch them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Before his life is half over he will lose his ill-gotten gains.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>At the end of his life it will be clear he was a fool.”
## Jeremiah Appeals to the Lord for Vindication
###### 12
<span class=verse-first>12</span>Then I said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Lᴏʀᴅ, from the very beginning
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You have been seated on your glorious throne on high.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You are the place where we can find refuge.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You are the one in whom Israel may find hope.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All who leave you will suffer shame.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those who turn away from you will be consigned to the netherworld.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For they have rejected you, the Lᴏʀᴅ, the fountain of life.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Lᴏʀᴅ, grant me relief from my suffering
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So that I may have some relief;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Rescue me from those who persecute me
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So that I may be rescued, for you give me reason to praise!
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Listen to what they are saying to me,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Where are the things the Lᴏʀᴅ threatens us with?
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>May it please happen!’
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But I have not pestered you to bring disaster.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have not desired the time of irreparable devastation.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You know that.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You are fully aware of every word that I have spoken.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not cause me dismay!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You are my source of safety in times of trouble.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>May those who persecute me be disgraced.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not let me be disgraced.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>May they be dismayed.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not let me be dismayed.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Bring days of disaster on them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Bring on them the destruction they deserve.”
## Observance of the Sabbath Day Is a Key to the Future
###### 19
<span class=verse-first>19</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ told me, “Go and stand in the People’s Gate through which the kings of Judah enter and leave the city. Then go and stand in all the other gates of the city of Jerusalem.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>“And then announce to them, ‘Listen to the Lᴏʀᴅ’s message, you kings of Judah, and everyone from Judah, and all you citizens of Jerusalem, those who pass through these gates.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>‘The Lᴏʀᴅ says, Be very careful if you value your lives! Do not carry any loads in through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>‘Do not carry any loads out of your houses or do any work on the Sabbath day. But observe the Sabbath day as a day set apart to the Lᴏʀᴅ, as I commanded your ancestors.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>‘Your ancestors, however, did not listen to me or pay any attention to me. They stubbornly refused to pay attention or to respond to any discipline.’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 24
<span class=verse-first>24</span>“The Lᴏʀᴅ says, ‘You must make sure to obey me. You must not bring any loads through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day. You must set the Sabbath day apart to me. You must not do any work on that day.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>‘If you do this, then the kings and princes who follow in David’s succession and ride in chariots or on horses will continue to enter through these gates, as well as their officials and the people of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem. This city will always be filled with people.
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>‘Then people will come here from the towns in Judah, from the villages surrounding Jerusalem, from the territory of Benjamin, from the foothills, from the southern hill country, and from the southern part of Judah. They will come bringing offerings to the temple of the Lᴏʀᴅ: burnt offerings, sacrifices, grain offerings, and incense along with their thank offerings.
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>‘But you must obey me and set the Sabbath day apart to me. You must not carry any loads in through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. If you disobey, I will set the gates of Jerusalem on fire. It will burn down all the fortified dwellings in Jerusalem and no one will be able to put it out.’”
