## Passions and Pride
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Where do the conflicts and where do the quarrels among you come from? Is it not from this, from your passions that battle inside you?
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>You desire and you do not have; you murder and envy and you cannot obtain; you quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask;
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>you ask and do not receive because you ask wrongly, so you can spend it on your passions.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>Adulterers, do you not know that friendship with the world means hostility toward God? So whoever decides to be the world’s friend makes himself God’s enemy.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>Or do you think the scripture means nothing when it says, “The spirit that God caused to live within us has an envious yearning”?
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>But he gives greater grace. Therefore it says, “God opposes the proud, but he gives grace to the humble.”
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>So submit to God. But resist the devil and he will flee from you.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>Draw near to God and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and make your hearts pure, you double-minded.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>Grieve, mourn, and weep. Turn your laughter into mourning and your joy into despair.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt you.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>Do not speak against one another, brothers and sisters. He who speaks against a fellow believer or judges a fellow believer speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but its judge.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>But there is only one who is lawgiver and judge—the one who is able to save and destroy. On the other hand, who are you to judge your neighbor?
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go into this or that town and spend a year there and do business and make a profit.”
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>You do not know about tomorrow. What is your life like? For you are a puff of smoke that appears for a short time and then vanishes.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>You ought to say instead, “If the Lord is willing, then we will live and do this or that.”
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>But as it is, you boast about your arrogant plans. All such boasting is evil.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>So whoever knows what is good to do and does not do it is guilty of sin.
