###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ is my light and my salvation.
>I fear no one.
>The Lᴏʀᴅ protects my life.
>I am afraid of no one.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>When evil men attack me
>To devour my flesh,
>When my adversaries and enemies attack me,
>They stumble and fall.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Even when an army is deployed against me,
>I do not fear.
>Even when war is imminent,
>I remain confident.

###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span>I have asked the Lᴏʀᴅ for one thing—
>This is what I desire!
>I want to live in the Lᴏʀᴅ’s house all the days of my life,
>So I can gaze at the splendor of the Lᴏʀᴅ
>And contemplate in his temple.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>He will surely give me shelter in the day of danger;
>He will hide me in his home.
>He will place me on an inaccessible rocky summit.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Now I will triumph
>Over my enemies who surround me.
>I will offer sacrifices in his dwelling place and shout for joy.
>I will sing praises to the Lᴏʀᴅ.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span>Hear me, O Lᴏʀᴅ, when I cry out.
>Have mercy on me and answer me.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>My heart tells me to pray to you,
>And I do pray to you, O Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>Do not reject me.
>Do not push your servant away in anger.
>You are my deliverer.
>Do not forsake or abandon me,
>O God who vindicates me.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Even if my father and mother abandoned me,
>The Lᴏʀᴅ would take me in.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
><span class=verse-first-poetry>11</span>Teach me how you want me to live, Lᴏʀᴅ;
>Lead me along a level path because of those who wait to ambush me.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Do not turn me over to my enemies,
>For false witnesses who want to destroy me testify against me.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>Where would I be if I did not believe I would experience
>The Lᴏʀᴅ’s favor in the land of the living?
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>Rely on the Lᴏʀᴅ!
>Be strong and confident!
>Rely on the Lᴏʀᴅ!
