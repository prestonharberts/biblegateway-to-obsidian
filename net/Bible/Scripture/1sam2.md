## Hannah Exalts the Lord in Prayer
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Hannah prayed,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My heart has rejoiced in the Lᴏʀᴅ;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My horn has been raised high because of the Lᴏʀᴅ.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have loudly denounced my enemies.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed I rejoice in your deliverance.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No one is holy like the Lᴏʀᴅ!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There is no one other than you!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There is no rock like our God!
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Don’t keep speaking so arrogantly.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Proud talk should not come out of your mouth,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ is a God who knows;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He evaluates what people do.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The bows of warriors are shattered,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But those who stumbled have taken on strength.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The well fed hire themselves out to earn food,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But the hungry no longer lack.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even the barren woman has given birth to seven,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But the one with many children has declined.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ both kills and gives life;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He brings down to the grave and raises up.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ impoverishes and makes wealthy;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He humbles and he exalts.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He lifts the weak from the dust;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He raises the poor from the ash heap
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To seat them with princes—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He bestows on them an honored position.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The foundations of the earth belong to the Lᴏʀᴅ—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He placed the world on them.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He watches over his holy ones,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But the wicked are made speechless in the darkness,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For it is not by one’s own strength that one prevails.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ shatters his adversaries;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He thunders against them from the heavens.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ executes judgment to the ends of the earth.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will strengthen his king
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And exalt the power of his anointed one.”

###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>Then Elkanah went back home to Ramah.
## Eli’s Sons Misuse Their Sacred Office
The boy Samuel was serving the Lᴏʀᴅ with the favor of Eli the priest.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 12
<span class=verse-first>12</span>But the sons of Eli were wicked men. They did not acknowledge the Lᴏʀᴅ’s authority.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>This was the priests’ routine with the people. Whenever anyone was making a sacrifice, the priest’s attendant would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand, just as the meat was boiling.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>He would jab it into the basin, kettle, cauldron, or pot. Everything that the fork would bring up the priest would take for himself. This is how they used to treat all the Israelites who came there to Shiloh.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>Also, before they burned the fat the priest’s attendant would come and say to the person who was making the sacrifice, “Give some meat for the priest to roast! He won’t accept boiled meat from you, but only raw.”
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>If the individual said to him, “They should certainly burn the fat away first, then take for yourself whatever you wish,” then he would say, “No! Give it now! If not, I’ll take it by force!”
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>The sin of these young men was very great in the Lᴏʀᴅ’s sight, for they treated the Lᴏʀᴅ’s offering with contempt.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span>Now Samuel was ministering with the favor of the Lᴏʀᴅ. The boy was dressed in a linen ephod.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>His mother used to make him a small robe and bring it to him from time to time when she would go up with her husband to make the annual sacrifice.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife saying, “May the Lᴏʀᴅ establish descendants for you from this woman in place of the one that she dedicated to the Lᴏʀᴅ.” Then they would go to their home.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 21
<span class=verse-first>21</span>And indeed the Lᴏʀᴅ attended to Hannah. She got pregnant and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. But the boy Samuel grew up before the Lᴏʀᴅ.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 22
<span class=verse-first>22</span>Eli was very old. And he would hear about everything that his sons used to do to all the people of Israel and how they used to go to bed with the women who were stationed at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>So he said to them, “Why do you do these things, these evil things that I hear about from all these people?
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>“No, my sons! For the report that I hear circulating among the Lᴏʀᴅ’s people is not good.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>“If a man sins against a man, one may appeal to God on his behalf. But if a man sins against the Lᴏʀᴅ, who can intercede for him?” But Eli’s sons would not listen to their father. Indeed the Lᴏʀᴅ had decided to kill them.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 26
<span class=verse-first>26</span>However, the boy Samuel was growing up and finding favor both with the Lᴏʀᴅ and with people.
## The Lord Judges the House of Eli
###### 27
<span class=verse-first>27</span>Then a man of God came to Eli and said to him, “This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ has said: ‘I plainly revealed myself to your ancestor’s house when they were slaves to the house of Pharaoh in Egypt.
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>‘I chose your ancestor from all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer sacrifice on my altar, to burn incense, and to bear the ephod before me. I gave to your ancestor’s house all the fire offerings made by the Israelites.
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>‘Why are you scorning my sacrifice and my offering that I commanded for my dwelling place? You have honored your sons more than you have me by having made yourselves fat from the best parts of all the offerings of my people Israel.’
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>“Therefore the Lᴏʀᴅ, the God of Israel, says, ‘I really did say that your house and your ancestor’s house would serve me forever.’ But now the Lᴏʀᴅ says, ‘May it never be! For I will honor those who honor me, but those who despise me will be cursed!
###### 31
<span class=verse-body>31</span>“In fact, days are coming when I will remove your strength and the strength of your father’s house. There will not be an old man in your house!
###### 32
<span class=verse-body>32</span>“You will see trouble in my dwelling place! Israel will experience blessings, but there will not be an old man in your house for all time.
###### 33
<span class=verse-body>33</span>“Any man of yours that I do not cut off from my altar, I will cause his eyes to fail and will cause him grief. All those born to your family will die by the sword of man.
###### 34
<span class=verse-body>34</span>“This will be a confirming sign for you that will be fulfilled through your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas: in a single day they both will die!
###### 35
<span class=verse-body>35</span>“Then I will raise up for myself a faithful priest. He will do what is in my heart and soul. I will build for him a lasting dynasty, and he will serve my chosen one for all time.
###### 36
<span class=verse-body>36</span>“Everyone who remains in your house will come to bow before him for a little money and for a scrap of bread. Each will say, “Assign me to a priestly task so I can eat a scrap of bread.”’”
