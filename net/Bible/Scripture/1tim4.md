## Timothy’s Ministry in the Later Times
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Now the Spirit explicitly says that in the later times some will desert the faith and occupy themselves with deceiving spirits and demonic teachings,
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>influenced by the hypocrisy of liars whose consciences are seared.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>They will prohibit marriage and require abstinence from foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>For every creation of God is good and no food is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>For it is sanctified by God’s word and by prayer.

###### 6
<span class=verse-first>6</span>By pointing out such things to the brothers and sisters, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, having nourished yourself on the words of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>But reject those myths fit only for the godless and gullible, and train yourself for godliness.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>For “physical exercise has some value, but godliness is valuable in every way. It holds promise for the present life and for the life to come.”
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>This saying is trustworthy and deserves full acceptance.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>In fact this is why we work hard and struggle, because we have set our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of believers.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>Command and teach these things.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>Let no one look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in your speech, conduct, love, faithfulness, and purity.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>Until I come, give attention to the public reading of scripture, to exhortation, to teaching.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>Do not neglect the spiritual gift you have, given to you and confirmed by prophetic words when the elders laid hands on you.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>Take pains with these things; be absorbed in them, so that everyone will see your progress.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>Be conscientious about how you live and what you teach. Persevere in this, because by doing so you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.
