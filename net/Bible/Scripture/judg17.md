## Micah Makes His Own Religion
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>There was a man named Micah from the Ephraimite hill country.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>He said to his mother, “You know the 1,100 pieces of silver which were stolen from you, about which I heard you pronounce a curse? Look here, I have the silver. I stole it, but now I am giving it back to you.” His mother said, “May the Lᴏʀᴅ reward you, my son!”
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>When he gave back to his mother the 1,100 pieces of silver, his mother said, “I solemnly dedicate this silver to the Lᴏʀᴅ. It will be for my son’s benefit. We will use it to make a carved image and a metal image.”
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>When he gave the silver back to his mother, she took 200 pieces of silver to a silversmith, who made them into a carved image and a metal image. She then put them in Micah’s house.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>Now this man Micah owned a shrine. He made an ephod and some personal idols and hired one of his sons to serve as a priest.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>In those days Israel had no king. Each man did what he considered to be right.
## Micah Hires a Professional
###### 7
<span class=verse-first>7</span>There was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah. He was a Levite who had been temporarily residing among the tribe of Judah.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>This man left the town of Bethlehem in Judah to find another place to live. He came to the Ephraimite hill country and made his way to Micah’s house.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>Micah said to him, “Where do you come from?” He replied, “I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah. I am looking for a new place to live.”
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>Micah said to him, “Stay with me. Become my adviser and priest. I will give you ten pieces of silver per year, plus clothes and food.”
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>So the Levite agreed to stay with the man; the young man was like a son to Micah.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>Micah paid the Levite; the young man became his priest and lived in Micah’s house.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>Micah said, “Now I know the Lᴏʀᴅ will make me rich, because I have this Levite as my priest.”
