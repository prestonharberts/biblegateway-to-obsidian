><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You have shed human blood
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And committed violent acts against lands, cities, and those who live in them.

###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For recognition of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s sovereign majesty will fill the earth

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You who make others intoxicated
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>By forcing them to drink from the bowl of your furious anger

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>What good is a metal image that gives misleading oracles?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why would its creator place his trust in it
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And make such mute, worthless things?
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Woe to the one who says to wood, ‘Wake up!’—
