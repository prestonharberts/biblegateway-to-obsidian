## Manasseh’s Reign
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned for fifty-five years in Jerusalem.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>He did evil in the sight of the Lᴏʀᴅ and committed the same horrible sins practiced by the nations whom the Lᴏʀᴅ drove out ahead of the Israelites.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>He rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had destroyed; he set up altars for the Baals and made Asherah poles. He bowed down to all the stars in the sky and worshiped them.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>He built altars in the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple, about which the Lᴏʀᴅ had said, “Jerusalem will be my permanent home.”
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>In the two courtyards of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple he built altars for all the stars in the sky.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>He passed his sons through the fire in the Valley of Ben Hinnom and practiced divination, omen reading, and sorcery. He set up a ritual pit to conjure up underworld spirits and appointed magicians to supervise it. He did a great amount of evil in the sight of the Lᴏʀᴅ and angered him.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>He put an idolatrous image he had made in God’s temple, about which God had said to David and to his son Solomon, “This temple in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will be my permanent home.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>“I will not make Israel again leave the land I gave to their ancestors, provided that they carefully obey all I commanded them, the whole law, the rules and regulations given through Moses.”
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>But Manasseh misled the people of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem so that they sinned more than the nations whom the Lᴏʀᴅ had destroyed ahead of the Israelites.

###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ confronted Manasseh and his people, but they paid no attention.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>So the Lᴏʀᴅ brought against them the commanders of the army of the king of Assyria. They seized Manasseh, put hooks in his nose, bound him with bronze chains, and carried him away to Babylon.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>In his pain Manasseh asked the Lᴏʀᴅ his God for mercy and truly humbled himself before the God of his ancestors.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>When he prayed to the Lᴏʀᴅ, the Lᴏʀᴅ responded to him and answered favorably his cry for mercy. The Lᴏʀᴅ brought him back to Jerusalem to his kingdom. Then Manasseh realized that the Lᴏʀᴅ is the true God.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
<span class=verse-first>14</span>After this Manasseh built up the outer wall of the City of David on the west side of the Gihon in the valley to the entrance of the Fish Gate and all around the terrace; he made it much higher. He placed army officers in all the fortified cities in Judah.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>He removed the foreign gods and images from the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple and all the altars he had built on the hill of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple and in Jerusalem; he threw them outside the city.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>He erected the altar of the Lᴏʀᴅ and offered on it peace offerings and thank offerings. He told the people of Judah to serve the Lᴏʀᴅ God of Israel.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>However, the people continued to offer sacrifices at the high places, but only to the Lᴏʀᴅ their God.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span>The rest of the events of Manasseh’s reign, including his prayer to his God and the words the prophets spoke to him in the name of the Lᴏʀᴅ God of Israel, are recorded in the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>The Annals of the Prophets include his prayer, give an account of how the Lᴏʀᴅ responded to it, record all his sins and unfaithful acts, and identify the sites where he built high places and erected Asherah poles and idols before he humbled himself.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>Manasseh passed away and was buried in his palace. His son Amon replaced him as king.
## Amon’s Reign
###### 21
<span class=verse-first>21</span>Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned for two years in Jerusalem.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>He did evil in the sight of the Lᴏʀᴅ, just as his father Manasseh had done. Amon offered sacrifices to all the idols his father Manasseh had made, and worshiped them.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>He did not humble himself before the Lᴏʀᴅ as his father Manasseh had done. Amon was guilty of great sin.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>His servants conspired against him and killed him in his palace.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>The people of the land executed all who had conspired against King Amon, and they made his son Josiah king in his place.
