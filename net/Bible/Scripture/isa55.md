## The Lord Gives an Invitation
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Hey, all who are thirsty, come to the water!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You who have no money, come!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Buy and eat!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Come! Buy wine and milk
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Without money and without cost.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why pay money for something that will not nourish you?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why spend your hard-earned money on something that will not satisfy?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Listen carefully to me and eat what is nourishing!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Enjoy fine food.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Pay attention and come to me.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Listen, so you can live.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then I will make an unconditional covenantal promise to you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Just like the reliable covenantal promises I made to David.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, I made him a witness to nations,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A ruler and commander of nations.”
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Look, you will summon nations you did not previously know;
>Nations that did not previously know you will run to you,
>Because of the Lᴏʀᴅ your God,
>The Holy One of Israel,
>For he bestows honor on you.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 6
><span class=verse-first-poetry>6</span>Seek the Lᴏʀᴅ while he makes himself available;
>Call to him while he is nearby!
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>The wicked need to abandon their lifestyle
>And sinful people their plans.
>They should return to the Lᴏʀᴅ, and he will show mercy to them,
>And to their God, for he will freely forgive them.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, my plans are not like your plans,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And my deeds are not like your deeds,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ,
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For just as the sky is higher than the earth,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So my deeds are superior to your deeds
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And my plans superior to your plans.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The rain and snow fall from the sky
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And do not return,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But instead water the earth
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And make it produce and yield crops,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And provide seed for the planter and food for those who must eat.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In the same way, the promise that I make
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Does not return to me, having accomplished nothing.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No, it is realized as I desire
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And is fulfilled as I intend.”
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Indeed you will go out with joy;
>You will be led along in peace;
>The mountains and hills will give a joyful shout before you,
>And all the trees in the field will clap their hands.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>Evergreens will grow in place of thorn bushes,
>Firs will grow in place of nettles;
>They will be a monument to the Lᴏʀᴅ,
>A permanent reminder that will remain.
