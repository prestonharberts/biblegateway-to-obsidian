## David Organizes the Priests
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The divisions of Aaron’s descendants were as follows:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

The sons of Aaron: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>Nadab and Abihu died before their father did; they had no sons. Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>David, Zadok (a descendant of Eleazar), and Ahimelech (a descendant of Ithamar) divided them into groups to carry out their assigned responsibilities.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>The descendants of Eleazar had more leaders than the descendants of Ithamar, so they divided them up accordingly; the descendants of Eleazar had sixteen leaders, while the descendants of Ithamar had eight.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>They divided them by lots, for there were officials of the Holy Place and officials designated by God among the descendants of both Eleazar and Ithamar.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>The scribe Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, wrote down their names before the king, the officials, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the leaders of the priestly and Levite families. One family was drawn by lot from Eleazar, and then the next from Ithamar.
