<span class=verse-first>1</span>Later King Nahash of the Ammonites died and his son succeeded him.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>David said, “I will express my loyalty to Hanun son of Nahash, for his father was loyal to me.” So David sent messengers to express his sympathy over his father’s death. When David’s servants entered Ammonite territory to visit Hanun and express the king’s sympathy,
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>the Ammonite officials said to Hanun, “Do you really think David is trying to honor your father by sending these messengers to express his sympathy? No, his servants have come to you so they can get information and spy out the land!”
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>So Hanun seized David’s servants and shaved their beards off. He cut off the lower part of their robes so that their buttocks were exposed and then sent them away.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>People came and told David what had happened to the men, so he sent messengers to meet them, for the men were thoroughly humiliated. The king said, “Stay in Jericho until your beards grow again; then you may come back.”

<span class=verse-first>6</span>When the Ammonites realized that David was disgusted with them, Hanun and the Ammonites sent 1,000 talents of silver to hire chariots and charioteers from Aram Naharaim, Aram Maacah, and Zobah.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>They hired 32,000 chariots, along with the king of Maacah and his army, who came and camped in front of Medeba. The Ammonites also assembled from their cities and marched out to do battle.

###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>When Joab saw that the battle would be fought on two fronts, he chose some of Israel’s best men and deployed them against the Arameans.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>He put his brother Abishai in charge of the rest of the army and they were deployed against the Ammonites.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>Joab said, “If the Arameans start to overpower me, you come to my rescue. If the Ammonites start to overpower you, I will come to your rescue.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>“Be strong! Let’s fight bravely for the sake of our people and the cities of our God! The Lᴏʀᴅ will do what he decides is best!”

<span class=verse-body>14</span>So Joab and his men marched toward the Arameans to do battle, and they fled before him.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>When the Ammonites saw the Arameans flee, they fled before Joab’s brother Abishai and withdrew into the city. Joab went back to Jerusalem.
