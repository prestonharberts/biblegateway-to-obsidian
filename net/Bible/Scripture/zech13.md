## The Refinement of Judah
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>“In that day there will be a fountain opened up for the dynasty of David and the people of Jerusalem to cleanse them from sin and impurity.

###### 2
<span class=verse-first>2</span>“And also on that day,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies, “I will remove the names of the idols from the land and they will never again be remembered. Moreover, I will remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“Then, if anyone prophesies in spite of this, his father and mother to whom he was born will say to him, ‘You cannot live, for you lie in the name of the Lᴏʀᴅ.’ Then his father and mother to whom he was born will run him through with a sword when he prophesies.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“Therefore, on that day each prophet will be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies and will no longer wear the hairy garment of a prophet to deceive the people.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“Instead he will say, ‘I am no prophet; indeed, I am a farmer, for a man has made me his indentured servant since my youth.’
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>“Then someone will ask him, ‘What are these wounds on your chest?’ and he will answer, ‘Some that I received in the house of my friends.’

###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Awake, sword, against my shepherd,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Against the man who is my associate,”
>Says the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Strike the shepherd that the flock may be scattered;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will turn my hand against the insignificant ones.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will happen in all the land,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That two-thirds of the people in it will be cut off and die,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But one-third will be left in it.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then I will bring the remaining third into the fire;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will refine them like silver is refined
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And will test them like gold is tested.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will call on my name and I will answer;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will say, ‘These are my people,’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And they will say, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ is our God.’”
