<span class=verse-body>2</span>“Take a census of the entire Israelite community by their clans and families, counting the name of every individual male.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“You and Aaron are to number all in Israel who can serve in the army, those who are twenty years old or older, by their divisions.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“And to help you there is to be a man from each tribe, each man the head of his family.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“Now these are the names of the men who are to help you:

## The Census of the Tribes

<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
<span class=verse-first>17</span>So Moses and Aaron took these men who had been mentioned specifically by name,
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>and they assembled the entire community together on the first day of the second month. Then the people recorded their ancestry by their clans and families, and the men who were twenty years old or older were listed by name individually,
