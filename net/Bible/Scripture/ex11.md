## Plague Ten: Death
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said to Moses, “I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt; after that he will release you from this place. When he releases you, he will drive you out completely from this place.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“Instruct the people that each man and each woman is to request from his or her neighbor items of silver and gold.”
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>(Now the Lᴏʀᴅ granted the people favor with the Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, respected by Pharaoh’s servants and by the Egyptian people.)

###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>‘and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, to the firstborn son of the slave girl who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>‘There will be a great cry throughout the whole land of Egypt, such as there has never been, nor ever will be again.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>‘But against any of the Israelites not even a dog will bark against either people or animals, so that you may know that the Lᴏʀᴅ distinguishes between Egypt and Israel.’
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>“All these your servants will come down to me and bow down to me, saying, ‘Go, you and all the people who follow you,’ and after that I will go out.” Then Moses went out from Pharaoh in great anger.

###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>So Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the Lᴏʀᴅ hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not release the Israelites from his land.
