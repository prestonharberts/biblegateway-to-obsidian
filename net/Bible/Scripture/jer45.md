## Baruch is Rebuked but also Comforted
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The prophet Jeremiah spoke to Baruch son of Neriah while he was writing down in a scroll the words that Jeremiah spoke to him. (This happened in the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was ruling over Judah.)
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>Jeremiah said, “The Lᴏʀᴅ God of Israel has a message for you, Baruch.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>‘You have said, “I feel so hopeless! For the Lᴏʀᴅ has added sorrow to my suffering. I am worn out from groaning. I can’t find any rest.”’”
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ told Jeremiah, “Tell Baruch, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ says, “I am about to tear down what I have built and to uproot what I have planted. I will do this throughout the whole earth.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>‘Are you looking for great things for yourself? Do not look for such things. For I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm that I am about to bring disaster on all humanity. But I will allow you to escape with your life wherever you go.”’”
