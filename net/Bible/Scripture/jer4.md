###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If you, Israel, want to come back,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If you want to come back to me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You must get those disgusting idols out of my sight
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And must no longer go astray.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You must be truthful, honest, and upright
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When you take an oath saying, ‘As surely as the Lᴏʀᴅ lives!’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If you do, the nations will pray to be as blessed by him as you are
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And will make him the object of their boasting.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 3
><span class=verse-first-poetry>3</span>Yes, this is what the Lᴏʀᴅ has said
>To the people of Judah and Jerusalem:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Break up your unplowed ground, do not cast seeds among thorns.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Commit yourselves to the Lᴏʀᴅ;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Dedicate your hearts to me
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>People of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Otherwise, my anger will blaze up like a flaming fire against you
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That no one will be able to extinguish.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That will happen because of the evil you have done.”
## Warning of Coming Judgment
###### 5
<span class=verse-first>5</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Announce this in Judah and proclaim it in Jerusalem:
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Sound the trumpet throughout the land!’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Shout out loudly,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Gather together! Let us flee into the fortified cities!’
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Raise a signal flag that tells people to go to Zion.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Run for safety! Do not delay!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I am about to bring disaster out of the north.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will bring great destruction.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a lion that has come up from its lair
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The one who destroys nations has set out from his home base.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He is coming out to lay your land waste.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your cities will become ruins and lie uninhabited.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So put on sackcloth!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Mourn and wail, saying,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The fierce anger of the Lᴏʀᴅ
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Has not turned away from us!’
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When this happens,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The king and his officials will lose their courage.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The priests will be struck with horror,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the prophets will be speechless in astonishment.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>In response to all this I said, “Ah, Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ, you have surely allowed the people of Judah and Jerusalem to be deceived by those who say, ‘You will be safe!’ But in fact a sword is already at our throats.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
><span class=verse-first-poetry>11</span>At that time the people of Judah and Jerusalem will be told,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A scorching wind will sweep down
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>From the hilltops in the wilderness on my dear people.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will not be a gentle breeze
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For winnowing the grain and blowing away the chaff.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No, a wind too strong for that will come at my bidding.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yes, even now I, myself, am calling down judgment on them.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look! The enemy is approaching like gathering clouds.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The roar of his chariots is like that of a whirlwind.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His horses move more swiftly than eagles.”
>I cry out, “We are doomed, for we will be destroyed!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
><span class=verse-first-poetry>14</span>O people of Jerusalem, purify your hearts from evil
>So that you may yet be delivered.
>How long will you continue to harbor up
>Wicked schemes within you?
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>For messengers are coming, heralding disaster,
>From the city of Dan and from the hills of Ephraim.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>They are saying,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Announce to the surrounding nations,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The enemy is coming!’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Proclaim this message to Jerusalem:
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Those who besiege cities are coming from a distant land.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They are ready to raise the battle cry against the towns in Judah.’
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will surround Jerusalem
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like men guarding a field
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because they have rebelled against me,”
>Says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The way you have lived and the things you have done
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will bring this on you.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>This is the punishment you deserve, and it will be painful indeed.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The pain will be so bad it will pierce your heart.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 19
<span class=verse-first>19</span>I said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Oh, the feeling in the pit of my stomach!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I writhe in anguish.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Oh, the pain in my heart!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My heart pounds within me.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I cannot keep silent.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I hear the sound of the trumpet;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The sound of the battle cry pierces my soul!
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I see one destruction after another taking place,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So that the whole land lies in ruins.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I see our tents suddenly destroyed,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their curtains torn down in a mere instant.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How long must I see the enemy’s battle flags
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And hear the military signals of their bugles?”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ answered,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>This will happen because my people are foolish.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They do not know me.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are like children who have no sense.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They have no understanding.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are skilled at doing evil.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They do not know how to do good.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 23
><span class=verse-first-poetry>23</span>I looked at the land and saw that it was an empty wasteland.
>I looked up at the sky, and its light had vanished.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span>I looked at the mountains and saw that they were shaking.
>All the hills were swaying back and forth!
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span>I looked and saw that there were no more people
>And that all the birds in the sky had flown away.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span>I looked and saw that the fruitful land had become a desert
>And that all the cities had been laid in ruins.
>The Lᴏʀᴅ had brought this all about
>Because of his blazing anger.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 27
><span class=verse-first-poetry>27</span>All this will happen because the Lᴏʀᴅ said,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The whole land will be desolate;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>However, I will not completely destroy it.
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because of this the land will mourn
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the sky above will grow black.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I have made my purpose known,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I will not relent or turn back from carrying it out.”
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span>At the sound of the approaching horsemen and archers
>The people of every town will flee.
>Some of them will hide in the thickets.
>Others will climb up among the rocks.
>All the cities will be deserted.
>No one will remain in them.
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span>And you, Zion, city doomed to destruction,
>You accomplish nothing by wearing a beautiful dress,
>Decking yourself out in jewels of gold,
>And putting on eye shadow!
>You are making yourself beautiful for nothing.
>Your lovers spurn you.
>They want to kill you.
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span>In fact, I hear a cry like that of a woman in labor,
>A cry of anguish like that of a woman giving birth to her first baby.
>It is the cry of Daughter Zion gasping for breath,
>Reaching out for help, saying, “I am done in!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My life is ebbing away before these murderers!”
