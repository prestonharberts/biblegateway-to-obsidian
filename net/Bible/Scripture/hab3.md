## Habakkuk’s Vision of the Divine Warrior
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>This is a prayer of Habakkuk the prophet:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 2
><span class=verse-first-poetry>2</span>Lᴏʀᴅ, I have heard the report of what you did;
>I am awed, Lᴏʀᴅ, by what you accomplished.
>In our time repeat those deeds;
>In our time reveal them again.
>But when you cause turmoil, remember to show us mercy!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 3
><span class=verse-first-poetry>3</span>God comes from Teman,
>The Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah.
>His splendor has covered the skies,
>The earth is full of his glory.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>His brightness will be as lightning;
>A two-pronged lightning bolt flashing from his hand.
>This is the outward display of his power.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Plague will go before him;
>Pestilence will march right behind him.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>He took his battle position and shook the earth;
>With a mere look he frightened the nations.
>The ancient mountains disintegrated;
>The primeval hills were flattened.
>His are ancient roads.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>I saw the tents of Cushan overwhelmed by trouble;
>The tent curtains of the land of Midian were shaking.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span>Was the Lᴏʀᴅ mad at the rivers?
>Were you angry with the rivers?
>Were you enraged at the sea?
>Such that you would climb into your horse-drawn chariots,
>Your victorious chariots?
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>Your bow is ready for action;
>You commission your arrows. Selah.
>You cause flash floods on the earth’s surface.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>When the mountains see you, they shake.
>The torrential downpour sweeps through.
>The great deep shouts out;
>It lifts its hands high.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>The sun and moon stand still in their courses;
>The flash of your arrows drives them away,
>The bright light of your lightning-quick spear.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>You furiously stomp on the earth;
>You angrily trample down the nations.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>You march out to deliver your people,
>To deliver your special servant.
>You strike the leader of the wicked nation,
>Laying him open from the lower body to the neck. Selah.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>You pierce the heads of his warriors with a spear.
>They storm forward to scatter us;
>They shout with joy as if they were plundering the poor with no opposition.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>But you trample on the sea with your horses,
>On the surging, raging waters.
## Habakkuk Declares His Confidence
###### 16
><span class=verse-first-poetry>16</span>I listened and my stomach churned;
>The sound made my lips quiver.
>My frame went limp, as if my bones were decaying,
>And I shook as I tried to walk.
>I long for the day of distress
>To come upon the people who attack us.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>When the fig tree does not bud,
>And there are no grapes on the vines;
>When the olive trees do not produce
>And the fields yield no crops;
>When the sheep disappear from the pen
>And there are no cattle in the stalls—
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>I will rejoice because of the Lᴏʀᴅ;
>I will be happy because of the God who delivers me!
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>The Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ is my source of strength.
>He gives me the agility of a deer;
>He enables me to negotiate the rugged terrain.
