###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Listen to this, all you nations.
>Pay attention, all you inhabitants of the world.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Pay attention, all you people,
>Both rich and poor.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>I will declare a wise saying;
>I will share my profound thoughts.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>I will learn a song that imparts wisdom;
>I will then sing my insightful song to the accompaniment of a harp.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 5
><span class=verse-first-poetry>5</span>Why should I be afraid in times of trouble,
>When the sinful deeds of deceptive men threaten to overwhelm me?
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>They trust in their wealth
>And boast in their great riches.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Certainly a man cannot rescue his brother;
>He cannot pay God an adequate ransom price
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>The ransom price for a human life is too high,
>And people go to their final destiny,
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>So that he might continue to live forever
>And not experience death.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
><span class=verse-first-poetry>10</span>Surely one sees that even wise people die;
>Fools and spiritually insensitive people all pass away
>And leave their wealth to others.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Their grave becomes their permanent residence,
>Their eternal dwelling place.
>They name their lands after themselves,
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>But, despite their wealth, people do not last.
>They are like animals that perish.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span>This is the destiny of fools,
>And of those who approve of their philosophy. (Selah)
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>They will travel to Sheol like sheep,
>With death as their shepherd.
>The godly will rule over them when the day of vindication dawns.
>Sheol will consume their bodies, and they will no longer live in impressive houses.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>But God will rescue my life from the power of Sheol;
>Certainly he will pull me to safety. (Selah)
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 16
><span class=verse-first-poetry>16</span>Do not be afraid when a man becomes rich
>And his wealth multiplies.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>For he will take nothing with him when he dies;
>His wealth will not follow him down into the grave.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>He pronounces this blessing on himself while he is alive:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>May men praise you, for you have done well.”
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>But he will join his ancestors;
>They will never again see the light of day.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>Wealthy people do not understand;
>They are like animals that perish.
