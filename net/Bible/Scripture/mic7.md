## Micah Laments Judah’s Sin
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Woe is me!
>For I am like those gathering fruit
>And those harvesting grapes,
>When there is no grape cluster to eat
>And no fresh figs that my stomach craves.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Faithful men have disappeared from the land;
>There are no godly men left.
>They all wait in ambush to shed blood;
>They hunt their own brother with a net.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>They are experts at doing evil;
>Government officials and judges take bribes,
>Prominent men announce what they wish,
>And then they plan it out.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>The best of them is like a thorn;
>Their godly are like a thorn bush.
>Woe to your watchmen;
>Your appointed punishment is on the way.
>The time of their confusion is now.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Do not rely on a friend;
>Do not trust a companion!
>Even with the one who lies in your arms,
>Do not share secrets!
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>For a son thinks his father is a fool,
>A daughter challenges her mother,
>And a daughter-in-law her mother-in-law;
>A man’s enemies are his own family.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span>But I will keep watching for the Lᴏʀᴅ;
>I will wait for the God who delivers me.
>My God will listen to me.
## Jerusalem Will Be Vindicated
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>My enemies, do not gloat over me!
>Though I have fallen, I will get up.
>Though I sit in darkness, the Lᴏʀᴅ will be my light.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span>I must endure the Lᴏʀᴅ’s fury,
>For I have sinned against him.
>But then he will defend my cause
>And accomplish justice on my behalf.
>He will lead me out into the light;
>I will witness his deliverance.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>When my enemies see this, they will be covered with shame.
>They say to me, “Where is the Lᴏʀᴅ your God?”
>I will gloat over them;
>Then they will be trampled down
>Like mud in the streets.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>It will be a day for rebuilding your walls;
>In that day your boundary will be extended.
## A Closing Prayer
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>In that day people will come to you
>From Assyria as far as Egypt,
>From Egypt as far as the Euphrates River,
>From the seacoasts and the mountains.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>The earth will become desolate
>Because of what its inhabitants have done.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
><span class=verse-first-poetry>14</span>Shepherd your people with your rod,
>The flock that belongs to you,
>The one that lives alone in a thicket,
>In the midst of a pastureland.
>Allow them to graze in Bashan and Gilead,
>As they did in the old days.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As in the days when you departed from the land of Egypt,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will show you miraculous deeds.”
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>Nations will see this and be disappointed by all their strength;
>They will put their hands over their mouths
>And act as if they were deaf.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>They will lick the dust like a snake,
>Like serpents crawling on the ground.
>They will come trembling from their strongholds
>To the Lᴏʀᴅ our God;
>They will be terrified of you.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>Who is a God like you?
>Who forgives sin
>And pardons the rebellion
>Of those who remain among his people?
>Who does not stay angry forever,
>But delights in showing loyal love?
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>Who will once again have mercy on us?
>Who will conquer our evil deeds?
>Who will hurl all our sins into the depths of the sea?
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>You will be loyal to Jacob
>And extend your loyal love to Abraham,
>Which you promised on oath to our ancestors in ancient times.
