## The Blessing of Victory for God’s People
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>At that time Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>went to war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboyim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>These last five kings joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea).
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>For twelve years they had served Kedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>In the fourteenth year, Kedorlaomer and the kings who were his allies came and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, the Emites in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>and the Horites in their hill country of Seir, as far as El Paran, which is near the desert.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>Then they attacked En Mishpat (that is, Kadesh) again, and they conquered all the territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who were living in Hazezon Tamar.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboyim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) went out and prepared for battle. In the Valley of Siddim they met
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>Kedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of nations, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar. Four kings fought against five.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits. When the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, they fell into them, but some survivors fled to the hills.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>The four victorious kings took all the possessions and food of Sodom and Gomorrah and left.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>They also took Abram’s nephew Lot and his possessions when they left, for Lot was living in Sodom.

###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>A fugitive came and told Abram the Hebrew. Now Abram was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, the brother of Eshcol and Aner. (All these were allied by treaty with Abram.)
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>When Abram heard that his nephew had been taken captive, he mobilized his 318 trained men who had been born in his household, and he pursued the invaders as far as Dan.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>Then, during the night, Abram divided his forces against them and defeated them. He chased them as far as Hobah, which is north of Damascus.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>He retrieved all the stolen property. He also brought back his nephew Lot and his possessions, as well as the women and the rest of the people.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
<span class=verse-first>17</span>After Abram returned from defeating Kedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet Abram in the Valley of Shaveh (known as the King’s Valley).
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. (Now he was the priest of the Most High God.)
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>He blessed Abram, saying,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Blessed be Abram by the Most High God,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Creator of heaven and earth.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Worthy of praise is the Most High God,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who delivered your enemies into your hand.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of everything.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>Then the king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people and take the possessions for yourself.”
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>But Abram replied to the king of Sodom, “I raise my hand to the Lᴏʀᴅ, the Most High God, Creator of heaven and earth, and vow
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>“that I will take nothing belonging to you, not even a thread or the strap of a sandal. That way you can never say, ‘It is I who made Abram rich.’
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>“I will take nothing except compensation for what the young men have eaten. As for the share of the men who went with me—Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre—let them take their share.”
