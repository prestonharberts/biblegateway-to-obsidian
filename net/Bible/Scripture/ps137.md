###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>By the rivers of Babylon
>We sit down and weep
>When we remember Zion.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>On the poplars in her midst
>We hang our harps,
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>For there our captors ask us to compose songs;
>Those who mock us demand that we be happy, saying:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Sing for us a song about Zion!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span>How can we sing a song to the Lᴏʀᴅ
>In a foreign land?
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>If I forget you, O Jerusalem,
>May my right hand be crippled.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>May my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth,
>If I do not remember you,
>And do not give Jerusalem priority
>Over whatever gives me the most joy.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span>Remember, O Lᴏʀᴅ, what the Edomites did
>On the day Jerusalem fell.
>They said, “Tear it down, tear it down,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Right to its very foundation!”
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>O daughter Babylon, soon to be devastated,
>How blessed will be the one who repays you
>For what you dished out to us.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>How blessed will be the one who grabs your babies
>And smashes them on a rock.
