## David Brings the Ark to Jerusalem
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>David constructed buildings in the City of David; he then prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>Then David said, “Only the Levites may carry the ark of God, for the Lᴏʀᴅ chose them to carry the ark of the Lᴏʀᴅ and to serve before him perpetually.”
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring the ark of the Lᴏʀᴅ up to the place he had prepared for it.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>David gathered together the descendants of Aaron and the Levites:
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>From the descendants of Kohath: Uriel the leader and 120 of his relatives.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>From the descendants of Merari: Asaiah the leader and 220 of his relatives.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>From the descendants of Gershom: Joel the leader and 130 of his relatives.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>From the descendants of Elizaphan: Shemaiah the leader and 200 of his relatives.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>From the descendants of Hebron: Eliel the leader and 80 of his relatives.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>From the descendants of Uzziel: Amminadab the leader and 112 of his relatives.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar, along with the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>He told them: “You are the leaders of the Levites’ families. You and your relatives must consecrate yourselves and bring the ark of the Lᴏʀᴅ God of Israel up to the place I have prepared for it.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>“The first time you did not carry it; that is why the Lᴏʀᴅ God attacked us, because we did not ask him about the proper way to carry it.”
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>The priests and Levites consecrated themselves so they could bring up the ark of the Lᴏʀᴅ God of Israel.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>The descendants of Levi carried the ark of God on their shoulders with poles, just as Moses had commanded in keeping with the Lord’s instruction.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 16
<span class=verse-first>16</span>David told the leaders of the Levites to appoint some of their relatives as musicians; they were to play various instruments, including stringed instruments and cymbals, and to sing loudly and joyfully.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; one of his relatives, Asaph son of Berechiah; one of the descendants of Merari, Ethan son of Kushaiah;
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>along with some of their relatives who were second in rank, including Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, the gatekeepers.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>The musicians Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were to sound the bronze cymbals;
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play the harps according to the alamoth style;
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to play the lyres according to the sheminith style, as led by the director;
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>Kenaniah, the leader of the Levites, was in charge of transport, for he was well-informed on this matter;
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>Berechiah and Elkanah were guardians of the ark;
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer the priests were to blow the trumpets before the ark of God; Obed-Edom and Jehiel were also guardians of the ark.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 25
<span class=verse-first>25</span>So David, the leaders of Israel, and the commanders of units of a thousand went to bring up the ark of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s covenant from the house of Obed-Edom with celebration.
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>When God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s covenant, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>David was wrapped in a linen robe, as were all the Levites carrying the ark, the musicians, and Kenaniah the supervisor of transport and the musicians; David also wore a linen ephod.
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>All Israel brought up the ark of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s covenant; they were shouting, blowing trumpets, sounding cymbals, and playing stringed instruments.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 29
<span class=verse-first>29</span>As the ark of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s covenant entered the City of David, Michal, Saul’s daughter, looked out the window. When she saw King David jumping and celebrating, she despised him.
