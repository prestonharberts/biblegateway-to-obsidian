##### <span class=arrow-left></span>[[eccles6|Prev]]<span class=navigation-separator></span>[[eccles7notes|Notes]]<span class=navigation-separator></span>[[eccles8|Next]]<span class=arrow-right></span>
## Life is Brief and Death is Certain
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>A good reputation is better than precious perfume;
>Likewise, the day of one’s death is better than the day of one’s birth.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>It is better to go to a funeral
>Than a feast.
>For death is the destiny of every person,
>And the living should take this to heart.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Sorrow is better than laughter,
>Because sober reflection is good for the heart.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning,
>But the heart of fools is in the house of merrymaking.
## Frivolous Living Versus Wisdom
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>It is better for a person to receive a rebuke from those who are wise
>Than to listen to the song of fools.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>For like the crackling of quick-burning thorns under a cooking pot,
>So is the laughter of the fool.
>This kind of folly also is useless.
## Human Wisdom Overturned by Adversity
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Surely oppression can turn a wise person into a fool;
>Likewise, a bribe corrupts the heart.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>The end of a matter is better than its beginning;
>Likewise, patience is better than pride.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>Do not let yourself be quickly provoked,
>For anger resides in the lap of fools.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Do not say, “Why were the old days better than these days?”
>For it is not wise to ask that.
## Wisdom Can Lengthen One’s Life
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Wisdom, like an inheritance, is a good thing;
>It benefits those who see the light of day.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>For wisdom provides protection,
>Just as money provides protection.
>But the advantage of knowledge is this:
>Wisdom preserves the life of its owner.
## Wisdom Acknowledges God’s Orchestration of Life
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>Consider the work of God:
>For who can make straight what he has bent?
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>In times of prosperity be joyful,
>But in times of adversity consider this:
>God has made one as well as the other,
>So that no one can discover what the future holds.
## Exceptions to the Law of Retribution
###### 15
><span class=verse-first-poetry>15</span>During the days of my fleeting life I have seen both of these things:
>Sometimes a righteous person dies prematurely in spite of his righteousness,
>And sometimes a wicked person lives long in spite of his evil deeds.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>So do not be excessively righteous or excessively wise;
>Otherwise you might be disappointed.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>Do not be excessively wicked and do not be a fool;
>Otherwise you might die before your time.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>It is best to take hold of one warning without letting go of the other warning;
>For the one who fears God will follow both warnings.
## Wisdom Needed Because No One is Truly Righteous
###### 19
><span class=verse-first-poetry>19</span>Wisdom gives a wise person more protection
>Than ten rulers in a city.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>For there is not one truly righteous person on the earth
>Who continually does good and never sins.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>Also, do not pay attention to everything that people say;
>Otherwise, you might even hear your servant cursing you.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>For you know in your own heart
>That you also have cursed others many times.
## Human Wisdom is Limited
###### 23
><span class=verse-first-poetry>23</span>I have examined all this by wisdom;
>I said, “I am determined to comprehend this”—but it was beyond my grasp.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span>Whatever has happened is beyond human understanding;
>It is far deeper than anyone can fathom.
## True Righteousness and Wisdom Are Virtually Nonexistent
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span>I tried to understand, examine, and comprehend
>The role of wisdom in the scheme of things,
>And to understand the stupidity of wickedness and the insanity of folly.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span>I discovered this:
>More bitter than death is the kind of woman who is like a hunter’s snare;
>Her heart is like a hunter’s net and her hands are like prison chains.
>The man who pleases God escapes her,
>But the sinner is captured by her.

###### 27
><span class=verse-first-poetry>27</span>The Teacher says:
>I discovered this while trying to discover the scheme of things, item by item.
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span>What I have continually sought, I have not found;
>I have found only one upright man among a thousand,
>But I have not found one upright woman among all of them.
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span>This alone have I discovered: God made humankind upright,
>But they have sought many evil schemes.
