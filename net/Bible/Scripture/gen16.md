## The Birth of Ishmael
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had not given birth to any children, but she had an Egyptian servant named Hagar.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>So Sarai said to Abram, “Since the Lᴏʀᴅ has prevented me from having children, please sleep with my servant. Perhaps I can have a family by her.” Abram did what Sarai told him.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>So after Abram had lived in Canaan for ten years, Sarai, Abram’s wife, gave Hagar, her Egyptian servant, to her husband to be his wife.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>He slept with Hagar, and she became pregnant. Once Hagar realized she was pregnant, she despised Sarai.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>Then Sarai said to Abram, “You have brought this wrong on me! I gave my servant into your embrace, but when she realized that she was pregnant, she despised me. May the Lᴏʀᴅ judge between you and me!”
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>Abram said to Sarai, “Since your servant is under your authority, do to her whatever you think best.” Then Sarai treated Hagar harshly, so she ran away from Sarai.

###### 7
<span class=verse-first>7</span>The angel of the Lᴏʀᴅ found Hagar near a spring of water in the wilderness—the spring that is along the road to Shur.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>He said, “Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?” She replied, “I’m running away from my mistress, Sarai.”
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>Then the angel of the Lᴏʀᴅ said to her, “Return to your mistress and submit to her authority.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“I will greatly multiply your descendants,” the angel of the Lᴏʀᴅ added, “so that they will be too numerous to count.”
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>Then the angel of the Lᴏʀᴅ said to her,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You are now pregnant
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And are about to give birth to a son.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You are to name him Ishmael,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ has heard your painful groans.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will be a wild donkey of a man.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will be hostile to everyone,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And everyone will be hostile to him.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will live away from his brothers.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>So Hagar named the Lᴏʀᴅ who spoke to her, “You are the God who sees me,” for she said, “Here I have seen one who sees me!”
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi. (It is located between Kadesh and Bered.)
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>So Hagar gave birth to Abram’s son, whom Abram named Ishmael.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>(Now Abram was 86 years old when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael.)
