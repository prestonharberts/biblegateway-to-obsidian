## David Commissions Solomon to Build the Temple
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>David assembled in Jerusalem all the officials of Israel, including the commanders of the tribes, the commanders of the army divisions that served the king, the commanders of units of a thousand and a hundred, the officials who were in charge of all the property and livestock of the king and his sons, the eunuchs, and the warriors, including the most skilled of them.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>King David rose to his feet and said: “Listen to me, my brothers and my people. I wanted to build a temple where the ark of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s covenant could be placed as a footstool for our God. I have made the preparations for building it.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“But God said to me, ‘You must not build a temple to honor me, for you are a warrior and have spilled blood.’
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“The Lᴏʀᴅ God of Israel chose me out of my father’s entire family to become king over Israel and have a permanent dynasty. Indeed, he chose Judah as leader, and my father’s family within Judah, and then he picked me out from among my father’s sons and made me king over all Israel.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“From all the many sons the Lᴏʀᴅ has given me, he chose Solomon my son to rule on his behalf over Israel.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>“He said to me, ‘Solomon your son is the one who will build my temple and my courts, for I have chosen him to become my son and I will become his father.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>‘I will establish his kingdom permanently, if he remains committed to obeying my commands and regulations, as you are doing this day.’
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>“So now, in the sight of all Israel, the Lᴏʀᴅ’s assembly, and in the hearing of our God, I say this: Carefully observe all the commands of the Lᴏʀᴅ your God, so that you may possess this good land and may leave it as a permanent inheritance for your children after you.

###### 9
<span class=verse-first>9</span>“And you, Solomon my son, obey the God of your father and serve him with a submissive attitude and a willing spirit, for the Lᴏʀᴅ examines all minds and understands every motive of one’s thoughts. If you seek him, he will let you find him, but if you abandon him, he will reject you permanently.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“Realize now that the Lᴏʀᴅ has chosen you to build a temple as his sanctuary. Be strong and do it!”
