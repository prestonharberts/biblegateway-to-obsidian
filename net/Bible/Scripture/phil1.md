## Salutation
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>From Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers and deacons.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!
## Prayer for the Church
###### 3
<span class=verse-first>3</span>I thank my God every time I remember you.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>I always pray with joy in my every prayer for all of you
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>because of your participation in the gospel from the first day until now.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>For I am sure of this very thing, that the one who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>For it is right for me to think this about all of you, because I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel all of you became partners in God’s grace together with me.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>For God is my witness that I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>And I pray this, that your love may abound even more and more in knowledge and every kind of insight
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>so that you can decide what is best, and thus be sincere and blameless for the day of Christ,
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God.
## Ministry as a Prisoner
###### 12
<span class=verse-first>12</span>I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that my situation has actually turned out to advance the gospel:
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>The whole imperial guard and everyone else knows that I am in prison for the sake of Christ,
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>and most of the brothers and sisters, having confidence in the Lord because of my imprisonment, now more than ever dare to speak the word fearlessly.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>Some, to be sure, are preaching Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from goodwill.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>The latter do so from love because they know that I am placed here for the defense of the gospel.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>The former proclaim Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, because they think they can cause trouble for me in my imprisonment.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>What is the result? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is being proclaimed, and in this I rejoice.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

Yes, and I will continue to rejoice,
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>for I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>My confident hope is that I will in no way be ashamed but that with complete boldness, even now as always, Christ will be exalted in my body, whether I live or die.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>For to me, living is Christ and dying is gain.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>Now if I am to go on living in the body, this will mean productive work for me, yet I don’t know which I prefer:
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>“I feel torn between the two, because I have a desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far,
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>“but it is more vital for your sake that I remain in the body.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>“And since I am sure of this, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for the sake of your progress and joy in the faith,
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>“so that what you can be proud of may increase because of me in Christ Jesus, when I come back to you.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 27
<span class=verse-first>27</span>“Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ so that—whether I come and see you or whether I remain absent—I should hear that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind, by contending side by side for the faith of the gospel,
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>“and by not being intimidated in any way by your opponents. This is a sign of their destruction, but of your salvation—a sign which is from God.
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>“For it has been granted to you not only to believe in Christ but also to suffer for him,
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>“since you are encountering the same conflict that you saw me face and now hear that I am facing.
