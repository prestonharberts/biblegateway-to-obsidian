## Breaking Human Traditions
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Now the Pharisees and some of the experts in the law who came from Jerusalem gathered around him.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>And they saw that some of Jesus’ disciples ate their bread with unclean hands, that is, unwashed.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they perform a ritual washing, holding fast to the tradition of the elders.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>And when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. They hold fast to many other traditions: the washing of cups, pots, kettles, and dining couches.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>The Pharisees and the experts in the law asked him, “Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with unwashed hands?”
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>He said to them, “Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>This people honors me with their lips,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>But their heart is far from me.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They worship me in vain,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Teaching as doctrine the commandments of men.’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>“Having no regard for the command of God, you hold fast to human tradition.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
<span class=verse-first>9</span>He also said to them, “You neatly reject the commandment of God in order to set up your tradition.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘Whoever insults his father or mother must be put to death.’
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>“But you say that if anyone tells his father or mother, ‘Whatever help you would have received from me is corban’ (that is, a gift for God),
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>“then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>“Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like this.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
<span class=verse-first>14</span>Then he called the crowd again and said to them, “Listen to me, everyone, and understand.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>“There is nothing outside of a person that can defile him by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a person that defiles him.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
<span class=verse-first>17</span>Now when Jesus had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about the parable.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>He said to them, “Are you so foolish? Don’t you understand that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him?
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>“For it does not enter his heart but his stomach, and then goes out into the sewer.” (This means all foods are clean.)
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>He said, “What comes out of a person defiles him.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>“For from within, out of the human heart, come evil ideas, sexual immorality, theft, murder,
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>“adultery, greed, evil, deceit, debauchery, envy, slander, pride, and folly.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>“All these evils come from within and defile a person.”
## A Syrophoenician Woman’s Faith
###### 24
<span class=verse-first>24</span>After Jesus left there, he went to the region of Tyre. When he went into a house, he did not want anyone to know, but he was not able to escape notice.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>Instead, a woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit immediately heard about him and came and fell at his feet.
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>The woman was a Greek, of Syrophoenician origin. She asked him to cast the demon out of her daughter.
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>He said to her, “Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not right to take the children’s bread and to throw it to the dogs.”
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>She answered, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>Then he said to her, “Because you said this, you may go. The demon has left your daughter.”
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>She went home and found the child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.
## Healing a Deaf Mute
###### 31
<span class=verse-first>31</span>Then Jesus went out again from the region of Tyre and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee in the region of the Decapolis.
###### 32
<span class=verse-body>32</span>They brought to him a deaf man who had difficulty speaking, and they asked him to place his hands on him.
###### 33
<span class=verse-body>33</span>After Jesus took him aside privately, away from the crowd, he put his fingers in the man’s ears, and after spitting, he touched his tongue.
###### 34
<span class=verse-body>34</span>Then he looked up to heaven and said with a sigh, “Ephphatha” (that is, “Be opened”).
###### 35
<span class=verse-body>35</span>And immediately the man’s ears were opened, his tongue loosened, and he spoke plainly.
###### 36
<span class=verse-body>36</span>Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone. But as much as he ordered them not to do this, they proclaimed it all the more.
###### 37
<span class=verse-body>37</span>People were completely astounded and said, “He has done everything well. He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.”
