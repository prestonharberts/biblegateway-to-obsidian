###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ, do not continue to rebuke me in your anger.
>Do not continue to punish me in your raging fury.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>For your arrows pierce me,
>And your hand presses me down.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>My whole body is sick because of your judgment;
>I am deprived of health because of my sin.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>For my sins overwhelm me;
>Like a heavy load, they are too much for me to bear.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>My wounds are infected and starting to smell,
>Because of my foolish sins.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>I am dazed and completely humiliated;
>All day long I walk around mourning.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>For I am overcome with shame,
>And my whole body is sick.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>I am numb with pain and severely battered;
>I groan loudly because of the anxiety I feel.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span>O Lord, you understand my heart’s desire;
>My groaning is not hidden from you.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>My heart beats quickly;
>My strength leaves me.
>I can hardly see.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Because of my condition, even my friends and acquaintances keep their distance;
>My neighbors stand far away.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Those who seek my life try to entrap me;
>Those who want to harm me speak destructive words.
>All day long they say deceitful things.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span>But I am like a deaf man—I hear nothing;
>I am like a mute who cannot speak.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>I am like a man who cannot hear
>And is incapable of arguing his defense.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>Yet I wait for you, O Lᴏʀᴅ!
>You will respond, O Lord, my God!
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>I have prayed for deliverance, because otherwise they will gloat over me;
>When my foot slips they will arrogantly taunt me.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>For I am about to stumble,
>And I am in constant pain.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>Yes, I confess my wrongdoing,
>And I am concerned about my sins.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>But those who are my enemies for no reason are numerous;
>Those who hate me without cause outnumber me.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>They repay me evil for the good I have done;
>Though I have tried to do good to them, they hurl accusations at me.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>Do not abandon me, O Lᴏʀᴅ.
>My God, do not remain far away from me.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>Hurry and help me, O Lord, my deliverer.
