## The Parable of the Lost Sheep and Coin
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming to hear him.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>But the Pharisees and the experts in the law were complaining, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 3
<span class=verse-first>3</span>So Jesus told them this parable:
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“Which one of you, if he has a hundred sheep and loses one of them, would not leave the ninety-nine in the open pasture and go look for the one that is lost until he finds it?
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“Then when he has found it, he places it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>“Returning home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, telling them, ‘Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost.’
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“I tell you, in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need to repent.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>“Or what woman, if she has ten silver coins and loses one of them, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search thoroughly until she finds it?
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>“Then when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.’
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of God’s angels over one sinner who repents.”
## The Parable of the Compassionate Father
###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>Then Jesus said, “A man had two sons.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>“The younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the share of the estate that will belong to me.’ So he divided his assets between them.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>“After a few days, the younger son gathered together all he had and left on a journey to a distant country, and there he squandered his wealth with a wild lifestyle.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>“Then after he had spent everything, a severe famine took place in that country, and he began to be in need.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>“So he went and worked for one of the citizens of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>“He was longing to eat the carob pods the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>“But when he came to his senses he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired workers have food enough to spare, but here I am dying from hunger!
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>‘I will get up and go to my father and say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>‘I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me like one of your hired workers.”’
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>“So he got up and went to his father. But while he was still a long way from home his father saw him, and his heart went out to him; he ran and hugged his son and kissed him.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>“Then his son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>“But the father said to his slaves, ‘Hurry! Bring the best robe, and put it on him! Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet!
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>‘Bring the fattened calf and kill it! Let us eat and celebrate,
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>‘because this son of mine was dead, and is alive again—he was lost and is found!’ So they began to celebrate.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 25
<span class=verse-first>25</span>“Now his older son was in the field. As he came and approached the house, he heard music and dancing.
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>“So he called one of the slaves and asked what was happening.
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>“The slave replied, ‘Your brother has returned, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he got his son back safe and sound.’
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>“But the older son became angry and refused to go in. His father came out and appealed to him,
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>“but he answered his father, ‘Look! These many years I have worked like a slave for you, and I never disobeyed your commands. Yet you never gave me even a goat so that I could celebrate with my friends!
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>‘But when this son of yours came back, who has devoured your assets with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him!’
###### 31
<span class=verse-body>31</span>“Then the father said to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and everything that belongs to me is yours.
###### 32
<span class=verse-body>32</span>‘It was appropriate to celebrate and be glad, for your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost and is found.’”
