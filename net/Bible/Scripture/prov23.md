###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>When you sit down to eat with a ruler,
>Consider carefully what is before you,
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>And put a knife to your throat
>If you possess a large appetite.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Do not crave that ruler’s delicacies,
>For that food is deceptive.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span>Do not wear yourself out to become rich;
>Be wise enough to restrain yourself.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>When you gaze upon riches, they are gone,
>For they surely make wings for themselves,
>And fly off into the sky like an eagle!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 6
><span class=verse-first-poetry>6</span>Do not eat the food of a stingy person,
>Do not crave his delicacies;
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>For he is like someone who has calculated the cost in his mind.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Eat and drink,” he says to you,
>But his heart is not with you;
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>You will vomit up the little bit you have eaten,
>And will have wasted your pleasant words.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span>Do not speak in the ears of a fool,
>For he will despise the wisdom of your words.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
><span class=verse-first-poetry>10</span>Do not move an ancient boundary stone,
>Or take over the fields of the fatherless,
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>For their Protector is strong;
>He will plead their case against you.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Apply your heart to instruction
>And your ears to the words of knowledge.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span>Do not withhold discipline from a child;
>Even if you strike him with the rod, he will not die.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>If you strike him with the rod,
>You will deliver him from death.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
><span class=verse-first-poetry>15</span>My child, if your heart is wise,
>Then my heart also will be glad;
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>My soul will rejoice
>When your lips speak what is right.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
><span class=verse-first-poetry>17</span>Do not let your heart envy sinners,
>But rather be zealous in fearing the Lᴏʀᴅ all the time.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>For surely there is a future,
>And your hope will not be cut off.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>Listen, my child, and be wise,
>And guide your heart on the right way.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>Do not spend time among drunkards,
>Among those who eat too much meat,
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>Because drunkards and gluttons become impoverished,
>And drowsiness clothes them with rags.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 22
><span class=verse-first-poetry>22</span>Listen to your father who gave you life,
>And do not despise your mother when she is old.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span>Acquire truth and do not sell it—
>Wisdom, and discipline, and understanding.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 24
><span class=verse-first-poetry>24</span>The father of a righteous person will rejoice greatly;
>Whoever fathers a wise child will have joy in him.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span>May your father and your mother have joy;
>May she who bore you rejoice.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 26
><span class=verse-first-poetry>26</span>Give me your heart, my son,
>And let your eyes observe my ways;
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span>For a prostitute is like a deep pit;
>A harlot is like a narrow well.
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span>Indeed, she lies in wait like a robber,
>And increases the unfaithful among men.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 29
><span class=verse-first-poetry>29</span>Who has woe? Who has sorrow?
>Who has contentions? Who has complaints?
>Who has wounds without cause? Who has dullness of the eyes?
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span>Those who linger over wine,
>Those who go looking for mixed wine.
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span>Do not look on the wine when it is red,
>When it sparkles in the cup,
>When it goes down smoothly.
###### 32
><span class=verse-body-poetry>32</span>Afterward it bites like a snake,
>And stings like a viper.
###### 33
><span class=verse-body-poetry>33</span>Your eyes will see strange things,
>And your mind will speak perverse things.
###### 34
><span class=verse-body-poetry>34</span>And you will be like one who lies down in the midst of the sea,
>And like one who lies down on the top of the rigging.
###### 35
><span class=verse-body-poetry>35</span>You will say, “They have struck me, but I am not harmed!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They beat me, but I did not know it!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When will I awake? I will look for another drink.”
