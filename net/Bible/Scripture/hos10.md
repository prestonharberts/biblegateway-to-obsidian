## Israel is Guilty of Fertility Cult Worship
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Israel was a fertile vine
>That yielded fruit.
>As his fruit multiplied,
>He multiplied altars to Baal.

###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Their hearts are slipping;
>Soon they will be punished for their guilt.
>The Lᴏʀᴅ will break their altars;
>He will completely destroy their fertility pillars.
## The Lord Will Punish Israel by Removing Its Kings
###### 3
><span class=verse-first-poetry>3</span>Very soon they will say, “We have no king
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Since we did not fear the Lᴏʀᴅ.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But what can a king do for us anyway?”
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>They utter empty words,
>Taking false oaths and making empty agreements.
>Therefore legal disputes sprout up
>Like poisonous weeds in the furrows of a plowed field.
## The Calf Idol and Idolaters of Samaria Will Be Exiled
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>The inhabitants of Samaria will lament over the calf idol of Beth Aven.
>Its people will mourn over it;

>Because its splendor will be taken from them into exile.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Even the calf idol will be carried to Assyria,
>As tribute for the great king.
>Ephraim will be disgraced;
>Israel will be put to shame because of its wooden idol.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Samaria and its king will be carried off
>Like a twig on the surface of the waters.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>The high places of the “House of Wickedness” will be destroyed;
>It is the place where Israel sins.
>Thorns and thistles will grow up over its altars.

>And to the hills, “Fall on us!”
## Failure to Learn from the Sin and Judgment of Gibeah
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>O Israel, you have sinned since the time of Gibeah,
>And there you have remained.
>Did not war overtake the evildoers in Gibeah?
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>When I please, I will discipline them;
>I will gather nations together to attack them,
>To bind them in chains for their two sins.
## Fertility Imagery: Plowing, Sowing, and Reaping
###### 11
><span class=verse-first-poetry>11</span>Ephraim was a well-trained heifer who loved to thresh grain;
>I myself put a fine yoke on her neck.

###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Sow righteousness for yourselves,

>For it is time to seek the Lᴏʀᴅ,
>Until he comes and showers deliverance on you.
###### 13

>You have reaped injustice;
>You have eaten the fruit of deception.
>Because you have depended on your chariots;
>You have relied on your many warriors.
## Bethel Will Be Destroyed Like Beth Arbel
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>The roar of battle will rise against your people;
>All your fortresses will be devastated,
>Just as Shalman devastated Beth Arbel on the day of battle,
>When mothers were dashed to the ground with their children.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>So will it happen to you, O Bethel,
>Because of your great wickedness!
>When that day dawns,
>The king of Israel will be destroyed.
