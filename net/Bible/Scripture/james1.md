## Salutation
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>From James, a slave of God and the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes dispersed abroad. Greetings!
## Joy in Trials
###### 2
<span class=verse-first>2</span>My brothers and sisters, consider it nothing but joy when you fall into all sorts of trials,
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>And let endurance have its perfect effect, so that you will be perfect and complete, not deficient in anything.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 5
<span class=verse-first>5</span>But if anyone is deficient in wisdom, he should ask God, who gives to all generously and without reprimand, and it will be given to him.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>But he must ask in faith without doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed around by the wind.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord,
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>since he is a double-minded individual, unstable in all his ways.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
<span class=verse-first>9</span>Now the believer of humble means should take pride in his high position.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>But the rich person’s pride should be in his humiliation, because he will pass away like a wildflower in the meadow.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>For the sun rises with its heat and dries up the meadow; the petal of the flower falls off and its beauty is lost forever. So also the rich person in the midst of his pursuits will wither away.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 12
<span class=verse-first>12</span>Happy is the one who endures testing, because when he has proven to be genuine, he will receive the crown of life that God promised to those who love him.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am tempted by God,” for God cannot be tempted by evil, and he himself tempts no one.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>But each one is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desires.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>Then when desire conceives, it gives birth to sin, and when sin is full grown, it gives birth to death.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>Do not be led astray, my dear brothers and sisters.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>All generous giving and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or the slightest hint of change.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>By his sovereign plan he gave us birth through the message of truth, that we would be a kind of firstfruits of all he created.
## Living Out the Message
###### 19
<span class=verse-first>19</span>Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters! Let every person be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>For human anger does not accomplish God’s righteousness.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>So put away all filth and evil excess and humbly welcome the message implanted within you, which is able to save your souls.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>But be sure you live out the message and do not merely listen to it and so deceive yourselves.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>For if someone merely listens to the message and does not live it out, he is like someone who gazes at his own face in a mirror.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>For he gazes at himself and then goes out and immediately forgets what sort of person he was.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>But the one who peers into the perfect law of liberty and fixes his attention there, and does not become a forgetful listener but one who lives it out—he will be blessed in what he does.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 26
<span class=verse-first>26</span>If someone thinks he is religious yet does not bridle his tongue, and so deceives his heart, his religion is futile.
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>Pure and undefiled religion before God the Father is this: to care for orphans and widows in their adversity and to keep oneself unstained by the world.
