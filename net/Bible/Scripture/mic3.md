## God Will Judge Judah’s Sinful Leaders
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>I said,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Listen, you leaders of Jacob,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You rulers of the nation of Israel!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You ought to know what is just,
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yet you hate what is good
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And love what is evil.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You flay my people’s skin
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And rip the flesh from their bones.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You devour my people’s flesh,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Strip off their skin,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And crush their bones.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You chop them up like flesh in a pot—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like meat in a kettle.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Someday these sinful leaders will cry to the Lᴏʀᴅ for help,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But he will not answer them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will hide his face from them at that time,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because they have done such wicked deeds.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 5
<span class=verse-first>5</span>This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ has said about the prophets who mislead my people,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If someone gives them enough to eat,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They offer an oracle of peace.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But if someone does not give them food,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are ready to declare war on him.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Therefore night will fall, and you will receive no visions;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will grow dark, and you will no longer be able to read the omens.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The sun will set on these prophets,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the daylight will turn to darkness over their heads.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The prophets will be ashamed;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The omen readers will be humiliated.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All of them will cover their mouths,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For they will receive no divine oracles.”
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>But I am full of the courage that the Lᴏʀᴅ’s Spirit gives
>And have a strong commitment to justice.
>This enables me to confront Jacob with its rebellion
>And Israel with its sin.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>Listen to this, you leaders of the family of Jacob,
>You rulers of the nation of Israel!
>You hate justice
>And pervert all that is right.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>You build Zion through bloody crimes,
>Jerusalem through unjust violence.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Her leaders take bribes when they decide legal cases,
>Her priests proclaim rulings for profit,
>And her prophets read omens for pay.
>Yet they claim to trust the Lᴏʀᴅ and say,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ is among us.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Disaster will not overtake us!”
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Therefore, because of you, Zion will be plowed up like a field,
>Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins,
>And the Temple Mount will become a hill overgrown with brush!
