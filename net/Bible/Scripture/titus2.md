<span class=verse-body>10</span>not pilfering, but showing all good faith, in order to bring credit to the teaching of God our Savior in everything.

<span class=verse-body>12</span>It trains us to reject godless ways and worldly desires and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age,
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>as we wait for the happy fulfillment of our hope in the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>He gave himself for us to set us free from every kind of lawlessness and to purify for himself a people who are truly his, who are eager to do good.

###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>So communicate these things with the sort of exhortation or rebuke that carries full authority. Donâ€™t let anyone look down on you.
