## Invocation of Witnesses
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Listen, O heavens, and I will speak;
>Hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>My teaching will drop like the rain,
>My sayings will drip like the dew,
>As rain drops upon the grass,
>And showers upon new growth.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>For I will proclaim the name of the Lᴏʀᴅ;
>You must acknowledge the greatness of our God.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>As for the Rock, his work is perfect,
>For all his ways are just.
>He is a reliable God who is never unjust,
>He is fair and upright.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>His people have been unfaithful to him;
>They have not acted like his children—this is their sin.
>They are a perverse and deceitful generation.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Is this how you repay the Lᴏʀᴅ,
>You foolish, unwise people?
>Is he not your father, your Creator?
>He has made you and established you.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Remember the ancient days;
>Bear in mind the years of past generations.
>Ask your father and he will inform you,
>Your elders, and they will tell you.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance,
>When he divided up humankind,
>He set the boundaries of the peoples,
>According to the number of the heavenly assembly.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ’s allotment is his people,
>Jacob is his special possession.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ found him in a desolate land,
>In an empty wasteland where animals howl.
>He continually guarded him and taught him;
>He continually protected him like the pupil of his eye.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Like an eagle that stirs up its nest,
>That hovers over its young,
>So the Lᴏʀᴅ spread out his wings and took him,
>He lifted him up on his pinions.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ alone was guiding him,
>No foreign god was with him.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>He enabled him to travel over the high terrain of the land,
>And he ate of the produce of the fields.
>He provided honey for him from the cliffs,
>And olive oil from the hardest of rocks,
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>Butter from the herd
>And milk from the flock,
>Along with the fat of lambs,
>Rams and goats of Bashan,
>Along with the best of the kernels of wheat;
>And from the juice of grapes you drank wine.
## Israel’s Rebellion
###### 15
><span class=verse-first-poetry>15</span>But Jeshurun became fat and kicked;
>You got fat, thick, and stuffed!
>Then he deserted the God who made him,
>And treated the Rock who saved him with contempt.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>They made him jealous with other gods,
>They enraged him with abhorrent idols.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>They sacrificed to demons, not God,
>To gods they had not known;
>To new gods who had recently come along,
>Gods your ancestors had not known about.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>You forgot the Rock who fathered you,
>And put out of mind the God who gave you birth.
## A Word of Judgment
###### 19
><span class=verse-first-poetry>19</span>But the Lᴏʀᴅ took note and despised them
>Because his sons and daughters enraged him.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>He said, “I will reject them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will see what will happen to them;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For they are a perverse generation,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Children who show no loyalty.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They have made me jealous with false gods,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Enraging me with their worthless gods;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So I will make them jealous with a people they do not recognize,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>With a nation slow to learn I will enrage them.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For a fire has been kindled by my anger,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And it burns to lowest Sheol;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It consumes the earth and its produce,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And ignites the foundations of the mountains.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 23
><span class=verse-first-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will increase their disasters;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will use up my arrows on them.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will be starved by famine,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Eaten by plague, and bitterly stung;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will send the teeth of wild animals against them,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Along with the poison of creatures that crawl in the dust.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The sword will make people childless outside,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And terror will do so inside;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will destroy both the young man and the virgin,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The infant and the gray-haired man.”
## The Weakness of Other Gods
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I said, ‘I want to cut them in pieces.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I want to make people forget they ever existed.
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>But I fear the reaction of their enemies,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For their adversaries would misunderstand
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And say, “Our power is great,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And the Lᴏʀᴅ has not done all this!”’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 28
><span class=verse-first-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are a nation devoid of wisdom,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And there is no understanding among them.
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I wish that they were wise and could understand this,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And that they could comprehend what will happen to them.”
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span>How can one man chase a thousand of them,
>And two pursue ten thousand,
>Unless their Rock had delivered them up—
>And the Lᴏʀᴅ had handed them over?
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span>For our enemies’ rock is not like our Rock,
>As even our enemies concede.
###### 32
><span class=verse-body-poetry>32</span>For their vine is from the stock of Sodom,
>And from the fields of Gomorrah.
>Their grapes contain venom;
>Their clusters of grapes are bitter.
###### 33
><span class=verse-body-poetry>33</span>Their wine is snakes’ poison,
>The deadly venom of cobras.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 34
><span class=verse-first-poetry>34</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is this not stored up with me?” says the Lᴏʀᴅ,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is it not sealed up in my storehouses?
###### 35
><span class=verse-body-poetry>35</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will get revenge and pay them back
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>At the time their foot slips;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the day of their disaster is near,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the impending judgment is rushing upon them!”
###### 36
><span class=verse-body-poetry>36</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ will judge his people,
>And will change his plans concerning his servants;
>When he sees that their power has disappeared,
>And that no one is left, whether confined or set free.
###### 37
><span class=verse-body-poetry>37</span>He will say, “Where are their gods,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The rock in whom they sought security,
###### 38
><span class=verse-body-poetry>38</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who ate the best of their sacrifices,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And drank the wine of their drink offerings?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let them rise and help you;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let them be your refuge!”
## The Vindication of the Lord
###### 39
><span class=verse-body-poetry>39</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>See now that I, indeed I, am he!” says the Lᴏʀᴅ,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And there is no other god besides me.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I kill and give life,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I smash and I heal,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And none can resist my power.
###### 40
><span class=verse-body-poetry>40</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I raise up my hand to heaven,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And say, ‘As surely as I live forever,
###### 41
><span class=verse-body-poetry>41</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will sharpen my lightning-like sword,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And my hand will grasp hold of the weapon of judgment;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will execute vengeance on my foes,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And repay those who hate me!
###### 42
><span class=verse-body-poetry>42</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will make my arrows drunk with blood,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And my sword will devour flesh—
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The blood of the slaughtered and captured,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The chief of the enemy’s leaders.’”
###### 43
><span class=verse-body-poetry>43</span>Cry out, O nations, with his people,
>For he will avenge his servants’ blood;
>He will take vengeance against his enemies,
>And make atonement for his land and people.
## Narrative Interlude
###### 44
<span class=verse-first>44</span>Then Moses went with Joshua son of Nun and recited all the words of this song to the people.
###### 45
<span class=verse-body>45</span>When Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel
###### 46
<span class=verse-body>46</span>he said to them, “Keep in mind all the words I am solemnly proclaiming to you today; you must command your children to observe carefully all the words of this law.
###### 47
<span class=verse-body>47</span>“For this is no idle word for you—it is your life! By this word you will live a long time in the land you are about to cross the Jordan to possess.”
## Instructions about Moses’ Death
###### 48
<span class=verse-first>48</span>Then the Lᴏʀᴅ said to Moses that same day,
###### 49
<span class=verse-body>49</span>“Go up to this Abarim hill country, to Mount Nebo (which is in the land of Moab opposite Jericho), and look at the land of Canaan that I am giving to the Israelites as a possession.
###### 50
<span class=verse-body>50</span>“You will die on the mountain that you ascend and join your deceased ancestors, just as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and joined his deceased ancestors,
###### 51
<span class=verse-body>51</span>“for both of you rebelled against me among the Israelites at the waters of Meribah Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin when you did not show me proper respect among the Israelites.
###### 52
<span class=verse-body>52</span>“You will see the land before you, but you will not enter the land that I am giving to the Israelites.”
