###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Then the people of Kiriath Jearim came and took the ark of the Lᴏʀᴅ; they brought it to the house of Abinadab located on the hill. They consecrated Eleazar his son to guard the ark of the Lᴏʀᴅ.
## Further Conflict with the Philistines
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>It was quite a long time—some twenty years in all—that the ark stayed at Kiriath Jearim. All the people of Israel longed for the Lᴏʀᴅ.

###### 3
<span class=verse-first>3</span>Samuel said to all the people of Israel, “If you are really turning to the Lᴏʀᴅ with all your hearts, remove from among you the foreign gods and the images of Ashtoreth. Give your hearts to the Lᴏʀᴅ and serve only him. Then he will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.”
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>So the Israelites removed the Baals and images of Ashtoreth. They served only the Lᴏʀᴅ.

###### 5
<span class=verse-first>5</span>Then Samuel said, “Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to the Lᴏʀᴅ on your behalf.”
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>After they had assembled at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out before the Lᴏʀᴅ. They fasted on that day, and they confessed there, “We have sinned against the Lᴏʀᴅ.” So Samuel led the people of Israel at Mizpah.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
<span class=verse-first>7</span>When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, the leaders of the Philistines went up against Israel. When the Israelites heard about this, they were afraid of the Philistines.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>The Israelites said to Samuel, “Keep crying out to the Lᴏʀᴅ our God so that he may save us from the hand of the Philistines!”
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>So Samuel took a nursing lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the Lᴏʀᴅ. Samuel cried out to the Lᴏʀᴅ on Israel’s behalf, and the Lᴏʀᴅ answered him.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>As Samuel was offering burnt offerings, the Philistines approached to do battle with Israel. But on that day the Lᴏʀᴅ thundered loudly against the Philistines. He caused them to panic, and they were defeated by Israel.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>Then the men of Israel left Mizpah and chased the Philistines, striking them down all the way to an area below Beth Car.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 12
<span class=verse-first>12</span>Samuel took a stone and placed it between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer, saying, “Up to here the Lᴏʀᴅ has helped us.”
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>So the Philistines were defeated; they did not invade Israel again. The hand of the Lᴏʀᴅ was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>The cities that the Philistines had captured from Israel were returned to Israel, from Ekron to Gath. Israel also delivered their territory from the control of the Philistines. There was also peace between Israel and the Amorites.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>So Samuel led Israel all the days of his life.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>Year after year he used to travel the circuit of Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah; he used to judge Israel in all these places.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>Then he would return to Ramah, because his home was there. He also judged Israel there and built an altar to the Lᴏʀᴅ there.
