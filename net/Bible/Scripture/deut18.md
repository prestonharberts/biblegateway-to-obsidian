## Provision for Priests and Levites
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Levitical priests—indeed, the entire tribe of Levi—will have no allotment or inheritance with Israel; they may eat the burnt offerings of the Lᴏʀᴅ and of his inheritance.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>They will have no inheritance in the midst of their fellow Israelites; the Lᴏʀᴅ alone is their inheritance, just as he had told them.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 3
<span class=verse-first>3</span>This shall be the priests’ fair allotment from the people who offer sacrifices, whether bull or sheep—they must give to the priest the shoulder, the jowls, and the stomach.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>You must give them the best of your grain, new wine, and olive oil, as well as the best of your wool when you shear your flocks.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ your God has chosen them and their sons from all your tribes to stand and serve in his name permanently.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 6
<span class=verse-first>6</span>Suppose a Levite comes by his own free will from one of your villages, from any part of Israel where he is living, to the place the Lᴏʀᴅ chooses
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>and serves in the name of the Lᴏʀᴅ his God like his fellow Levites who stand there before the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>He must eat the same share they do, despite any profits he may gain from the sale of his family’s inheritance.
## Prohibited Occult Practices
###### 9
<span class=verse-first>9</span>When you enter the land the Lᴏʀᴅ your God is giving you, you must not learn the abhorrent practices of those nations.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>There must never be found among you anyone who sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire, anyone who practices divination, an omen reader, a soothsayer, a sorcerer,
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>one who casts spells, one who conjures up spirits, a practitioner of the occult, or a necromancer.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>Whoever does these things is abhorrent to the Lᴏʀᴅ, and because of these detestable things the Lᴏʀᴅ your God is about to drive them out from before you.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>You must be blameless before the Lᴏʀᴅ your God.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>Those nations that you are about to dispossess listen to omen readers and diviners, but the Lᴏʀᴅ your God has not given you permission to do such things.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you—from your fellow Israelites; you must listen to him.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>This accords with what happened at Horeb in the day of the assembly. You asked the Lᴏʀᴅ your God: “Please do not make us hear the voice of the Lᴏʀᴅ our God anymore or see this great fire anymore lest we die.”
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ then said to me, “What they have said is good.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>“I will raise up a prophet like you for them from among their fellow Israelites. I will put my words in his mouth and he will speak to them whatever I command.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>“I will personally hold responsible anyone who then pays no attention to the words that prophet speaks in my name.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>“But if any prophet presumes to speak anything in my name that I have not authorized him to speak, or speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet must die.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>“Now if you say to yourselves, ‘How can we tell that a message is not from the Lᴏʀᴅ?’—
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>“whenever a prophet speaks in my name and the prediction is not fulfilled, then I have not spoken it; the prophet has presumed to speak it, so you need not fear him.”
