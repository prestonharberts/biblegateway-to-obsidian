## Ariel is Besieged
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Ariel is as good as dead—
>Ariel, the town David besieged!
>Keep observing your annual rituals;
>Celebrate your festivals on schedule.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>I will threaten Ariel,
>And she will mourn intensely
>And become like an altar hearth before me.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>I will lay siege to you on all sides;
>I will besiege you with troops;
>I will raise siege works against you.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>You will fall;
>While lying on the ground you will speak;
>From the dust where you lie, your words will be heard.
>Your voice will sound like a spirit speaking from the underworld;
>From the dust you will chirp as if muttering an incantation.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 5
><span class=verse-first-poetry>5</span>But the horde of invaders will be like fine dust,
>The horde of tyrants like chaff that is blown away.
>It will happen suddenly, in a flash.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Judgment will come from the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies,
>Accompanied by thunder, earthquake, and a loud noise,
>By a strong gale, a windstorm, and a consuming flame of fire.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>It will be like a dream, a night vision.
>There will be a horde from all the nations that fight against Ariel,
>Those who attack her and her stronghold and besiege her.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>It will be like a hungry man dreaming that he is eating,
>Only to awaken and find that his stomach is empty.
>It will be like a thirsty man dreaming that he is drinking,
>Only to awaken and find that he is still weak and his thirst unquenched.
>So it will be for the horde from all the nations
>That fight against Mount Zion.
## God’s People Are Spiritually Insensitive
###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span>You will be shocked and amazed!
>You are totally blind!
>They are drunk, but not because of wine;
>They stagger, but not because of beer.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ has poured out on you
>A strong urge to sleep deeply.
>He has shut your eyes (you prophets),
>And covered your heads (you seers).
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>To you this entire prophetic revelation is like words in a sealed scroll. When they hand it to one who can read and say, “Read this,” he responds, “I can’t, because it is sealed.”
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>Or when they hand the scroll to one who can’t read and say, “Read this,” he says, “I can’t read.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span>The Lord says,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>These people say they are loyal to me;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They say wonderful things about me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But they are not really loyal to me.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their worship consists of
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Nothing but man-made ritual.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Therefore I will again do an amazing thing for these people—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>An absolutely extraordinary deed.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Wise men will have nothing to say,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The sages will have no explanations.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
><span class=verse-first-poetry>15</span>Those who try to hide their plans from the Lᴏʀᴅ are as good as dead,
>Who do their work in secret and boast,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who sees us? Who knows what we’re doing?”
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>Your thinking is perverse!
>Should the potter be regarded as clay?
>Should the thing made say about its maker, “He didn’t make me”?
>Or should the pottery say about the potter, “He doesn’t understand”?
## Changes Are Coming
###### 17
><span class=verse-first-poetry>17</span>In just a very short time
>Lebanon will turn into an orchard,
>And the orchard will be considered a forest.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>At that time the deaf will be able to hear words read from a scroll,
>And the eyes of the blind will be able to see through deep darkness.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>The downtrodden will again rejoice in the Lᴏʀᴅ;
>The poor among humankind will take delight in the Holy One of Israel.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>For tyrants will disappear,
>Those who taunt will vanish,
>And all those who love to do wrong will be eliminated—
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>Those who bear false testimony against a person,
>Who entrap the one who arbitrates at the city gate
>And deprive the innocent of justice by making false charges.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 22
><span class=verse-first-poetry>22</span>So this is what the Lᴏʀᴅ, the one who delivered Abraham, has said to the family of Jacob:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Jacob will no longer be ashamed;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their faces will no longer show their embarrassment.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For when they see their children,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Whom I will produce among them,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will honor my name.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will honor the Holy One of Jacob;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will respect the God of Israel.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those who stray morally will gain understanding;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those who complain will acquire insight.
