## Death is Imminent
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Listen to this funeral song I am ready to sing about you, family of Israel:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The virgin Israel has fallen down and will not get up again.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>She is abandoned on her own land
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>With no one to help her get up.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>The Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says this:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The city that marches out with a thousand soldiers will have only a hundred left;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The town that marches out with a hundred soldiers will have only ten left for the family of Israel.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 4
<span class=verse-first>4</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ says this to the family of Israel:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Seek me so you can live!
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not seek Bethel.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not visit Gilgal.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not journey down to Beer Sheba.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the people of Gilgal will certainly be carried into exile,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And Bethel will become a place where disaster abounds.”
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Seek the Lᴏʀᴅ so you can live!
>Otherwise he will break out like fire against Joseph’s family;
>The fire will consume
>And no one will be able to quench it and save Bethel.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>The Israelites turn justice into bitterness;
>They throw what is fair and right to the ground.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span>But there is one who made the constellations Pleiades and Orion;
>He can turn the darkness into morning
>And daylight into night.
>He summons the water of the seas
>And pours it out on the earth’s surface.
>The Lᴏʀᴅ is his name!
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>He flashes destruction down upon the strong
>So that destruction overwhelms the fortified places.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
><span class=verse-first-poetry>10</span>The Israelites hate anyone who arbitrates at the city gate;
>They despise anyone who speaks honestly.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Therefore, because you make the poor pay taxes on their crops
>And exact a grain tax from them,
>You will not live in the houses you built with chiseled stone,
>Nor will you drink the wine from the fine vineyards you planted.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Certainly I am aware of your many rebellious acts
>And your numerous sins.
>You torment the innocent, you take bribes,
>And you deny justice to the needy at the city gate.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>For this reason whoever is smart keeps quiet in such a time,
>For it is an evil time.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
><span class=verse-first-poetry>14</span>Seek good and not evil so you can live!
>Then the Lᴏʀᴅ God of Heaven’s Armies just might be with you,
>As you claim he is.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>Hate what is wrong, love what is right.
>Promote justice at the city gate.
>Maybe the Lᴏʀᴅ God of Heaven’s Armies will have mercy on those who are left from Joseph.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 16
<span class=verse-first>16</span>Because of Israel’s sins this is what the Lord, the Lᴏʀᴅ God of Heaven’s Armies, says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In all the squares there will be wailing,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In all the streets they will mourn the dead.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will tell the field workers to lament
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the professional mourners to wail.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In all the vineyards there will be wailing,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I will pass through your midst,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
## The Lord Demands Justice
###### 18
><span class=verse-first-poetry>18</span>Woe to those who wish for the day of the Lᴏʀᴅ!
>Why do you want the Lᴏʀᴅ’s day of judgment to come?
>It will bring darkness, not light.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>Disaster will be inescapable,
>As if a man ran from a lion only to meet a bear,
>Then escaped into a house,
>Leaned his hand against the wall,
>And was bitten by a poisonous snake.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>Don’t you realize the Lᴏʀᴅ’s day of judgment will bring darkness, not light—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Gloomy blackness, not bright light?
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 21
><span class=verse-first-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I absolutely despise your festivals!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I get no pleasure from your religious assemblies.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even if you offer me burnt and grain offerings, I will not be satisfied;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will not look with favor on your peace offerings of fattened calves.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Take away from me your noisy songs;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I don’t want to hear the music of your stringed instruments.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Justice must flow like torrents of water,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Righteous actions like a stream that never dries up.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 25
><span class=verse-first-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You did not bring me sacrifices and grain offerings during the forty years you spent in the wilderness, family of Israel.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will pick up your images of Sikkuth, your king,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And Kiyyun, your star god, which you made for yourselves,
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I will drive you into exile beyond Damascus,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
>He is called the God of Heaven’s Armies.
