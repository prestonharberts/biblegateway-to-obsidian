## The Lord Will Judge a Distant Land in the South
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Beware, land of buzzing wings,
>The one beyond the rivers of Cush,
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>That sends messengers by sea,
>Who glide over the water’s surface in boats made of papyrus.
>Go, you swift messengers,
>To a nation of tall, smooth-skinned people,
>To a people that are feared far and wide,
>To a nation strong and victorious,
>Whose land rivers divide.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>All you who live in the world,
>Who reside on the earth,
>You will see a signal flag raised on the mountains;
>You will hear a trumpet being blown.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>For this is what the Lᴏʀᴅ has told me:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will wait and watch from my place,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like scorching heat produced by the sunlight,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a cloud of mist in the heat of harvest.”
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>For before the harvest, when the bud has sprouted,
>And the ripening fruit appears,
>He will cut off the unproductive shoots with pruning knives;
>He will prune the tendrils.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>They will all be left for the birds of the hills
>And the wild animals;
>The birds will eat them during the summer,
>And all the wild animals will eat them during the winter.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>At that time
>Tribute will be brought to the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies,
>By a people that are tall and smooth-skinned,
>A people that are feared far and wide,
>A nation strong and victorious,
>Whose land rivers divide.
>The tribute will be brought to the place where the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies has chosen to reside, on Mount Zion.
