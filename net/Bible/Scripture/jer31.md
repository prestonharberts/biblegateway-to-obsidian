><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The people of Israel who survived
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Death at the hands of the enemy
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will find favor in the wilderness

###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will rebuild you, my dear children Israel,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>So that you will once again be built up.

><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And join in the happy throng of dancers.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Once again you will plant vineyards
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>On the hills of Samaria.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Those who plant them
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Will once again enjoy their fruit.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Yes, a time is coming

<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Sing for joy for the descendants of Jacob.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Utter glad shouts for that foremost of the nations.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Make your praises heard.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then say, ‘Lᴏʀᴅ, rescue your people.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Deliver those of Israel who remain alive.’
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then I will reply, ‘I will bring them back from the land of the north.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will gather them in from the distant parts of the earth.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Blind and lame people will come with them,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>So will pregnant women and women about to give birth.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>A vast throng of people will come back here.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They will come back shedding tears of contrition.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will bring them back praying prayers of repentance.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will lead them besides streams of water,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Along smooth paths where they will never stumble.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will do this because I am Israel’s father;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Ephraim is my firstborn son.’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
><span class=verse-first-poetry>10</span>Listen to the Lord’s message, O nations.
>Proclaim it in the faraway lands along the sea.
>Say, “The one who scattered Israel will regather them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will watch over his people like a shepherd watches over his flock.”
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ will rescue the descendants of Jacob.
>He will secure their release from those who had overpowered them.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>They will come and shout for joy on Mount Zion.
>They will be radiant with joy over the good things the Lᴏʀᴅ provides,

>They will be like a well-watered garden
>And will not grow faint or weary any more.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ says, “At that time young women will dance and be glad.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Young men and old men will rejoice.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will turn their grief into gladness.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will give them comfort and joy in place of their sorrow.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will provide the priests with abundant provisions.

<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A sound is heard in Ramah,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A sound of crying in bitter grief.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It is the sound of Rachel weeping for her children
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And refusing to be comforted, because her children are gone.”
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ says to her,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Stop crying! Do not shed any more tears.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For your heartfelt repentance will be rewarded.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your children will return from the land of the enemy.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm it!
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, there is hope for your posterity.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your children will return to their own territory.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm it!
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have indeed heard the people of Israel say mournfully,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>We were like a calf untrained to the yoke.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You disciplined us and we learned from it.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Let us come back to you and we will do so,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For you are the Lᴏʀᴅ our God.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For after we turned away from you we repented.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>After we came to our senses we struck our thigh in sorrow.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>We are ashamed and humiliated
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Because of the disgraceful things we did previously.’
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, the people of Israel are my dear children.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are the children I take delight in.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For even though I must often rebuke them,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I still remember them with fondness.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So I am deeply moved with pity for them
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And will surely have compassion on them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm it!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 21
><span class=verse-first-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will say, ‘My dear children of Israel, keep in mind
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The road you took when you were carried off.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Mark off in your minds the landmarks.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Make a mental note of telltale signs marking the way back.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Return, my dear children of Israel.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Return to these cities of yours.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>How long will you vacillate,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You who were once like an unfaithful daughter?
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, promise to bring about something new on the earth,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Something as unique as a woman protecting a man!’”
## Judah Will Be Restored
###### 23
<span class=verse-first>23</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will restore the people of Judah to their land and to their towns.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When I do, they will again say of Jerusalem,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>May the Lᴏʀᴅ bless you, you holy mountain,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The place where righteousness dwells.’
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The land of Judah will be inhabited by people who live in its towns,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As well as by farmers and shepherds with their flocks.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will fully satisfy the needs of those who are weary
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And fully refresh the souls of those who are faint.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then they will say, ‘Under these conditions I can enjoy sweet sleep
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>When I wake up and look around.’
## Israel and Judah Will Be Repopulated
###### 27
<span class=verse-first>27</span>“Indeed, a time is coming,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ, “when I will cause people and animals to sprout up in the lands of Israel and Judah.
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>“In the past I saw to it that they were uprooted and torn down, that they were destroyed and demolished and brought disaster. But now I will see to it that they are built up and firmly planted. I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm it!”
## The Lord Will Make a New Covenant with Israel and Judah
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>“When that time comes, people will no longer say, ‘The parents have eaten sour grapes, but the children’s teeth have grown numb.’
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>“Rather, each person will die for his own sins. The teeth of the person who eats the sour grapes will themselves grow numb.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 31
<span class=verse-first>31</span>“Indeed, a time is coming,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ, “when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and Judah.
###### 32
<span class=verse-body>32</span>“It will not be like the old covenant that I made with their ancestors when I delivered them from Egypt. For they violated that covenant, even though I was like a faithful husband to them,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 33
<span class=verse-body>33</span>“But I will make a new covenant with the whole nation of Israel after I plant them back in the land,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ. “I will put my law within them and write it on their hearts and minds. I will be their God and they will be my people.
###### 34
<span class=verse-body>34</span>“People will no longer need to teach their neighbors and relatives to know me. For all of them, from the least important to the most important, will know me,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ. “For I will forgive their sin and will no longer call to mind the wrong they have done.”
## The Lord Guarantees Israel’s Continuance
###### 35
><span class=verse-first-poetry>35</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ has made a promise to Israel.
>He promises it as the one who fixed the sun to give light by day
>And the moon and stars to give light by night.
>He promises it as the one who stirs up the sea so that its waves roll.
>His name is the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies.
###### 36
><span class=verse-body-poetry>36</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ affirms, “The descendants of Israel will not
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Cease forever to be a nation in my sight.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That could only happen if the fixed ordering of the heavenly lights
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Were to cease to operate before me.”
###### 37
><span class=verse-body-poetry>37</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ says, “I will not reject all the descendants of Israel
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because of all that they have done.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That could only happen if the heavens above could be measured
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or the foundations of the earth below could all be explored,”
>Says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
## Jerusalem Will Be Enlarged
###### 38
<span class=verse-first>38</span>“Indeed a time is coming,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ, “when the city of Jerusalem will be rebuilt as my special city. It will be built from the Tower of Hananel westward to the Corner Gate.
###### 39
<span class=verse-body>39</span>“The boundary line will extend beyond that, straight west from there to the Hill of Gareb and then turn southward to Goah.
###### 40
<span class=verse-body>40</span>The whole valley where dead bodies and sacrificial ashes are thrown, and all the terraced fields out to the Kidron Valley on the east as far north as the corner of the Horse Gate, will be included within this city that is sacred to the Lᴏʀᴅ. The city will never again be torn down or destroyed.”
