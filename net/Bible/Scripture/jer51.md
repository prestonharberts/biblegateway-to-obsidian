><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not let yourselves be killed because of her sins,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For it is time for the Lᴏʀᴅ to wreak his revenge.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will pay Babylonia back for what she has done.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Babylonia had been a gold cup in the Lᴏʀᴅ’s hand;

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The nations had drunk from the wine of her wrath,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So they have all gone mad.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But suddenly Babylonia will fall and be destroyed.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Cry out in mourning over it!

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Perhaps she can be healed!
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Foreigners living there will say,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>We tried to heal her, but she could not be healed.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Let’s leave Babylonia and each go back to his own country.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For judgment on her will be vast in its proportions.

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ will arouse a spirit of hostility in the kings of Media,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For he intends to destroy Babylonia.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For that is how the Lᴏʀᴅ will get his revenge—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How he will get his revenge for the Babylonians’ destruction of his temple.
###### 12

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Every goldsmith will be disgraced by the idol he made.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the image he forges is merely a sham;

###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are worthless, objects to be ridiculed.

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He plans to make the land of Babylonia
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A wasteland where no one lives.
###### 30

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The soldiers are terrified.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 33
><span class=verse-first-poetry>33</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Fair Babylon will be like a threshing floor

###### 34
><span class=verse-first-poetry>34</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Devoured me and drove my people out.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a monster from the deep he swallowed me.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He filled his belly with my riches;

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He completely cleaned me out.”
###### 35
><span class=verse-body-poetry>35</span>The person who lives in Zion says,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>May Babylon pay for the violence done to me and to my relatives.”
>Jerusalem says,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>May those living in Babylonia pay for the bloodshed of my people.”
###### 36
><span class=verse-body-poetry>36</span>Therefore the Lᴏʀᴅ says,

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will pay the Babylonians back for what they have done to you.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will dry up their sea;

###### 37
><span class=verse-body-poetry>37</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Babylon will become a heap of ruins.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Jackals will make their home there.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will become an object of horror and of hissing scorn,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A place where no one lives.
###### 38
><span class=verse-body-poetry>38</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Babylonians are all like lions roaring for prey;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are like lion cubs growling for something to eat.
###### 39
><span class=verse-body-poetry>39</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When their appetites are all stirred up,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will set out a banquet for them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will make them drunk
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So that they will pass out,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will fall asleep forever,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will never wake up,”
>Says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 40
><span class=verse-body-poetry>40</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will lead them off to be slaughtered
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like lambs, rams, and male goats.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 41
><span class=verse-first-poetry>41</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>See how Babylon has been captured!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>See how the pride of the whole earth has been taken!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>See what an object of horror
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Babylon has become among the nations!
###### 42
><span class=verse-body-poetry>42</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The sea has swept over Babylon.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>She has been covered by a multitude of its waves.
###### 43
><span class=verse-body-poetry>43</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The towns of Babylonia have become heaps of ruins.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>She has become a dry and barren desert.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No one lives in those towns any more;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No one even passes through them.
###### 44
><span class=verse-body-poetry>44</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will punish the god Bel in Babylon.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will make him spit out what he has swallowed.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The nations will not come streaming to him any longer.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, the walls of Babylon will fall.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 45
><span class=verse-first-poetry>45</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Get out of Babylon, my people!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Flee to save your lives
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>From the fierce anger of the Lᴏʀᴅ!
###### 46
><span class=verse-body-poetry>46</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not lose your courage or become afraid
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because of the reports that are heard in the land.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For a report will come in one year.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Another report will follow it in the next.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There will be violence in the land
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>With ruler fighting against ruler.
###### 47
><span class=verse-body-poetry>47</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So the time will certainly come
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When I will punish the idols of Babylon.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Her whole land will be put to shame.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All her mortally wounded will collapse in her midst.
###### 48
><span class=verse-body-poetry>48</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then heaven and earth and all that is in them
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will sing for joy over Babylon.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For destroyers from the north will attack it,”
>Says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 49
><span class=verse-first-poetry>49</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Babylon must fall
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because of the Israelites she has killed,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Just as the earth’s mortally wounded fell
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because of Babylon.
###### 50
><span class=verse-body-poetry>50</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You who have escaped the sword,

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Remember the Lᴏʀᴅ in a faraway land.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Think about Jerusalem.
###### 51
><span class=verse-body-poetry>51</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>We are ashamed because we have been insulted.

<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 52
><span class=verse-first-poetry>52</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yes, but the time will certainly come,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When I will punish her idols.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Throughout her land the mortally wounded will groan.
###### 53
><span class=verse-body-poetry>53</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even if Babylon climbs high into the sky
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And fortifies her elevated stronghold,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will send destroyers against her,”
>Says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 54
><span class=verse-first-poetry>54</span>Cries of anguish will come from Babylon,
>The sound of great destruction from the land of the Babylonians.
###### 55
><span class=verse-body-poetry>55</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ is ready to destroy Babylon,
>And put an end to her loud noise.
>Their waves will roar like turbulent waters.
>They will make a deafening noise.
###### 56
><span class=verse-body-poetry>56</span>For a destroyer is attacking Babylon.
>Her warriors will be captured;
>Their bows will be broken.
>For the Lᴏʀᴅ is a God who punishes;
>He pays back in full.
###### 57
><span class=verse-body-poetry>57</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will make her officials and wise men drunk,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Along with her governors, leaders, and warriors.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will fall asleep forever and never wake up,”
>Says the King whose name is the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 58
<span class=verse-body>58</span>This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies says,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Babylon’s thick wall will be completely demolished.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Her high gates will be set on fire.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The peoples strive for what does not satisfy.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The nations grow weary trying to get what will be destroyed.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 59
<span class=verse-first>59</span>This is the order Jeremiah the prophet gave to Seraiah son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah, when he went to King Zedekiah of Judah in Babylon during the fourth year of his reign. (Seraiah was a quartermaster.)
###### 60
<span class=verse-body>60</span>Jeremiah recorded on one scroll all the judgments that would come upon Babylon—all these prophecies written about Babylon.
###### 61
<span class=verse-body>61</span>Then Jeremiah said to Seraiah, “When you arrive in Babylon, make sure you read aloud all these prophecies.
###### 62
<span class=verse-body>62</span>“Then say, ‘O Lᴏʀᴅ, you have announced that you will destroy this place so that no people or animals live in it any longer. Certainly it will lie desolate forever!’
###### 63
<span class=verse-body>63</span>“When you finish reading this scroll aloud, tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates River.
###### 64
<span class=verse-body>64</span>“Then say, ‘In the same way Babylon will sink and never rise again because of the disaster I am ready to bring upon her; they will grow faint.’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

The prophecies of Jeremiah end here.
