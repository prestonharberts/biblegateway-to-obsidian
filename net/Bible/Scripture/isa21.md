## The Lord Will Judge Babylon
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>This is an oracle about the wilderness by the Sea:
>Like strong winds blowing in the south,
>One invades from the wilderness,
>From a land that is feared.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>I have received a distressing message:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The deceiver deceives,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The destroyer destroys.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Attack, you Elamites!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Lay siege, you Medes!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will put an end to all the groaning.”
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>For this reason my stomach churns;
>Cramps overwhelm me
>Like the contractions of a woman in labor.
>I am disturbed by what I hear,
>Horrified by what I see.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>My heart palpitates,
>I shake in fear;
>The twilight I desired
>Has brought me terror.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Arrange the table,
>Lay out the carpet,
>Eat and drink!
>Get up, you officers,
>Smear oil on the shields!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>For this is what the Lord has told me:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Go, post a guard!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He must report what he sees.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When he sees chariots,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Teams of horses,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Riders on donkeys,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Riders on camels,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He must be alert,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Very alert.”
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Then the guard cries out:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>On the watchtower, O Lord,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I stand all day long;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>At my post
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I am stationed every night.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look what’s coming!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A charioteer,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A team of horses.”
>When questioned, he replies,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Babylon has fallen, fallen!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All the idols of her gods lie shattered on the ground!”
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>O my downtrodden people, crushed like stalks on the threshing floor,
>What I have heard
>From the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies,
>The God of Israel,
>I have reported to you.
## Bad News for Seir
###### 11
><span class=verse-first-poetry>11</span>This is an oracle about Dumah:
>Someone calls to me from Seir,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Watchman, what is left of the night?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Watchman, what is left of the night?”
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>The watchman replies,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Morning is coming, but then night.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If you want to ask, ask;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Come back again.”
## The Lord Will Judge Arabia
###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span>This is an oracle about Arabia:
>In the thicket of Arabia you spend the night,
>You Dedanite caravans.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>Bring out some water for the thirsty.
>You who live in the land of Tema,
>Bring some food for the fugitives.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>For they flee from the swords—
>From the drawn sword,
>And from the battle-ready bow,
>And from the severity of the battle.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 16
<span class=verse-first>16</span>For this is what the Lord has told me: “Within exactly one year all the splendor of Kedar will come to an end.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>“Just a handful of archers, the warriors of Kedar, will be left.” Indeed, the Lᴏʀᴅ God of Israel has spoken.
