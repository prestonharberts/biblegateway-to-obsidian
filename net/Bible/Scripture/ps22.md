###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?
>I groan in prayer, but help seems far away.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>My God, I cry out during the day,
>But you do not answer,
>And during the night my prayers do not let up.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>You are holy;
>You sit as king receiving the praises of Israel.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>In you our ancestors trusted;
>They trusted in you and you rescued them.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>To you they cried out, and they were saved;
>In you they trusted and they were not disappointed.

###### 6
><span class=verse-first-poetry>6</span>But I am a worm, not a man;
>People insult me and despise me.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>All who see me taunt me;
>They mock me and shake their heads.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>They say,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Commit yourself to the Lᴏʀᴅ!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let the Lᴏʀᴅ rescue him!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let the Lᴏʀᴅ deliver him, for he delights in him.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span>Yes, you are the one who brought me out from the womb
>And made me feel secure on my mother’s breasts.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>I have been dependent on you since birth;
>From the time I came out of my mother’s womb you have been my God.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
><span class=verse-first-poetry>11</span>Do not remain far away from me,
>For trouble is near and I have no one to help me.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Many bulls surround me;
>Powerful bulls of Bashan hem me in.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>They open their mouths to devour me
>Like a roaring lion that rips its prey.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>My strength drains away like water;
>All my bones are dislocated.
>My heart is like wax;
>It melts away inside me.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>The roof of my mouth is as dry as a piece of pottery;
>My tongue sticks to my gums.
>You set me in the dust of death.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>Yes, wild dogs surround me—
>A gang of evil men crowd around me;
>Like a lion they pin my hands and feet.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>I can count all my bones;
>My enemies are gloating over me in triumph.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>They are dividing up my clothes among themselves;
>They are rolling dice for my garments.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 19
><span class=verse-first-poetry>19</span>But you, O Lᴏʀᴅ, do not remain far away.
>You are my source of strength. Hurry and help me!
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>Deliver me from the sword.
>Save my life from the claws of the wild dogs.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>Rescue me from the mouth of the lion,
>And from the horns of the wild oxen.
>You have answered me.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 22

>In the middle of the assembly I will praise you.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span>You loyal followers of the Lᴏʀᴅ, praise him.
>All you descendants of Jacob, honor him.
>All you descendants of Israel, stand in awe of him.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span>For he did not despise or detest the suffering of the oppressed.
>He did not ignore him;
>When he cried out to him, he responded.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 25
><span class=verse-first-poetry>25</span>You are the reason I offer praise in the great assembly;
>I will fulfill my promises before the Lᴏʀᴅ’s loyal followers.

>And rules over the nations.
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span>All the thriving people of the earth will join the celebration and worship;
>All those who are descending into the grave will bow before him,
>Including those who cannot preserve their lives.
