## The Lord Recalls Israel’s Earlier Faithfulness
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ’s message came to me,
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“Go and declare in the hearing of the people of Jerusalem: ‘This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ says: “I have fond memories of you, how devoted you were to me in your early years. I remember how you loved me like a new bride; you followed me through the wilderness, through a land that had never been planted.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>‘Israel was set apart to the Lord; they were like the firstfruits of a harvest to him. All who tried to devour them were punished; disaster came upon them,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.’”
## The Lord Reminds Them of the Unfaithfulness of Their Ancestors
###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span>Now listen to the Lᴏʀᴅ’s message, you descendants of Jacob,
>All you family groups from the nation of Israel.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ says:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>What fault could your ancestors have possibly found in me
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That they strayed so far from me?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They paid allegiance to worthless idols, and so became worthless to me.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They did not ask,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Where is the Lᴏʀᴅ who delivered us out of Egypt,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Who brought us through the wilderness,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Through a land of valleys and gorges,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Through a land of desert and deep darkness,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Through a land in which no one travels,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And where no one lives?’
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I brought you into a fertile land
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So you could enjoy its fruits and its rich bounty.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But when you entered my land, you defiled it;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You made the land I call my own loathsome to me.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your priests did not ask, ‘Where is the Lᴏʀᴅ?’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those responsible for teaching my law did not really know me.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your rulers rebelled against me.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your prophets prophesied in the name of the god Baal.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They all worshiped idols that could not help them.”
## The Lord Charges Contemporary Israel with Spiritual Adultery
###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So, once more I will state my case against you,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will also state it against your children and grandchildren.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Go west across the sea to the coasts of Cyprus and see.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Send someone east to Kedar and have them look carefully.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>See if such a thing as this has ever happened:
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Has a nation ever changed its gods
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>(even though they are not really gods at all)?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But my people have exchanged me, their glorious God,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For a god that cannot help them at all!
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Be amazed at this, O heavens.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Be shocked and utterly dumbfounded,”
>Says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do so because my people have committed a double wrong:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They have rejected me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The fountain of life-giving water,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And they have dug cisterns for themselves,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Cracked cisterns that cannot even hold water.”
## Israel’s Reliance on Foreign Alliances (not on God)
###### 14
><span class=verse-first-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Israel is not a slave, is he?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He was not born into slavery, was he?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If not, why then is he being carried off?
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like lions his enemies roar victoriously over him;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They raise their voices in triumph.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They have laid his land waste;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His cities have been burned down and deserted.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even the soldiers from Memphis and Tahpanhes
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Have cracked your skulls, people of Israel.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You have brought all this on yourself, Israel,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>By deserting the Lᴏʀᴅ your God when he was leading you along the right path.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>What good will it do you then to go down to Egypt
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To seek help from the Egyptians?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>What good will it do you to go over to Assyria
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To seek help from the Assyrians?
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your own wickedness will bring about your punishment.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your unfaithful acts will bring down discipline on you.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Know, then, and realize how utterly harmful
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It was for you to reject me, the Lᴏʀᴅ your God,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To show no respect for me,”
>Says the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies.
## The Lord Expresses His Exasperation at Judah’s Persistent Idolatry
###### 20
><span class=verse-first-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, long ago you threw off my authority
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And refused to be subject to me.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You said, ‘I will not serve you.’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Instead, you gave yourself to other gods on every high hill
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And under every green tree,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a prostitute sprawls out before her lovers.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I planted you in the land
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a special vine of the very best stock.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why in the world have you turned into something like a wild vine
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That produces rotten, foul-smelling grapes?
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You can try to wash away your guilt with a strong detergent.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You can use as much soap as you want.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But the stain of your guilt is still there for me to see,”
>Says the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How can you say, ‘I have not made myself unclean.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I have not paid allegiance to the gods called Baal.’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Just look at the way you have behaved in the Valley of Hinnom!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Think about the things you have done there!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You are like a flighty, young female camel
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That rushes here and there, crisscrossing its path.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You are like a wild female donkey brought up in the wilderness.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In her lust she sniffs the wind to get the scent of a male.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No one can hold her back when she is in heat.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>None of the males need wear themselves out chasing after her.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>At mating time she is easy to find.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not chase after other gods until your shoes wear out
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And your throats become dry.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But you say, ‘It is useless for you to try and stop me
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Because I love those foreign gods and want to pursue them!’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 26
><span class=verse-first-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Just as a thief has to suffer dishonor when he is caught,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So the people of Israel will suffer dishonor for what they have done.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So will their kings and officials,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their priests and their prophets.
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They say to a wooden idol, ‘You are my father.’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They say to a stone image, ‘You gave birth to me.’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yes, they have turned away from me instead of turning to me.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yet when they are in trouble, they say, ‘Come and save us!’
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But where are the gods you made for yourselves?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let them save you when you are in trouble.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The sad fact is that you have as many gods
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As you have towns, Judah.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 29
><span class=verse-first-poetry>29</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why do you try to refute me?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All of you have rebelled against me,”
>Says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It did no good for me to punish your people.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They did not respond to such correction.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You slaughtered your prophets
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a voracious lion.
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You people of this generation,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Listen to the Lᴏʀᴅ’s message:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Have I been like a wilderness to you, Israel?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Have I been like a dark and dangerous land to you?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why then do you say, ‘We are free to wander.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>We will not come to you anymore?’
###### 32
><span class=verse-body-poetry>32</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Does a young woman forget to put on her jewels?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Does a bride forget to put on her bridal attire?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But my people have forgotten me
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For more days than can even be counted.
###### 33
><span class=verse-body-poetry>33</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My, how good you have become
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>At chasing after your lovers!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why, you could even teach prostitutes a thing or two!
###### 34
><span class=verse-body-poetry>34</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even your clothes are stained with
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The lifeblood of the poor who had not done anything wrong;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You did not catch them breaking into your homes.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yet, in spite of all these things you have done,
###### 35
><span class=verse-body-poetry>35</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You say, ‘I have not done anything wrong,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>So the Lᴏʀᴅ cannot really be angry with me any more.’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But, watch out! I will bring down judgment on you
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because you say, ‘I have not committed any sin.’
###### 36
><span class=verse-body-poetry>36</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why do you constantly go about
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Changing your political allegiances?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will get no help from Egypt
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Just as you got no help from Assyria.
###### 37
><span class=verse-body-poetry>37</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Moreover, you will come away from Egypt
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>With your hands covering your faces in sorrow and shame
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because the Lᴏʀᴅ will not allow your reliance on them to be successful
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And you will not gain any help from them.
