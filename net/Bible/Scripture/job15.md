###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Does a wise man answer with blustery knowledge,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or fill his belly with the east wind?
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Does he argue with useless talk,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>With words that have no value in them?
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But you even break off piety,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And hinder meditation before God.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your sin inspires your mouth;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You choose the language of the crafty.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your own mouth condemns you, not I;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your own lips testify against you.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Were you the first man ever born?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Were you brought forth before the hills?
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do you listen in on God’s secret council?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do you limit wisdom to yourself?
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>What do you know that we don’t know?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>What do you understand that we don’t understand?
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The gray-haired and the aged are on our side,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Men far older than your father.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Are God’s consolations too trivial for you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or a word spoken in gentleness to you?
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why has your heart carried you away,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And why do your eyes flash,
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When you turn your rage against God
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And allow such words to escape from your mouth?
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>What is man that he should be pure,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or one born of woman, that he should be righteous?
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If God places no trust in his holy ones,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If even the heavens are not pure in his eyes,
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How much less man, who is abominable and corrupt,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who drinks in evil like water!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
><span class=verse-first-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will explain to you;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Listen to me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And what I have seen, I will declare,
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>What wise men declare,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Hiding nothing,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>From the tradition of their ancestors,
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To whom alone the land was given
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When no foreigner passed among them.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All his days the wicked man suffers torment,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Throughout the number of the years
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That are stored up for the tyrant.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Terrifying sounds fill his ears;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In a time of peace marauders attack him.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He does not expect to escape from darkness;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He is marked for the sword;
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He wanders about—food for vultures—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He knows that the day of darkness is at hand.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Distress and anguish terrify him;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They prevail against him
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a king ready to launch an attack,
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For he stretches out his hand against God,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And vaunts himself against the Almighty,
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Defiantly charging against him
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>With a thick, strong shield!
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because he covered his face with fat,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And made his hips bulge with fat,
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He lived in ruined towns
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And in houses where no one lives,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Where they are ready to crumble into heaps.
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will not grow rich,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And his wealth will not endure,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Nor will his possessions spread over the land.
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will not escape the darkness;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A flame will wither his shoots
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And he will depart
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>By the breath of God’s mouth.
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let him not trust in what is worthless,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Deceiving himself;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For worthlessness will be his reward.
###### 32
><span class=verse-body-poetry>32</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Before his time he will be paid in full,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And his branches will not flourish.
###### 33
><span class=verse-body-poetry>33</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a vine he will let his sour grapes fall,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And like an olive tree
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will shed his blossoms.
###### 34
><span class=verse-body-poetry>34</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the company of the godless is barren,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And fire consumes the tents of those who accept bribes.
###### 35
><span class=verse-body-poetry>35</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They conceive trouble and bring forth evil;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their belly prepares deception.”
