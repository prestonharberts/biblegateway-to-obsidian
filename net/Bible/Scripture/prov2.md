## Benefits of Seeking Wisdom
###### 1

###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>By making your ear attentive to wisdom,

###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Indeed, if you call out for discernment—
>Shout loudly for understanding—
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>If you seek it like silver,
>And search for it like hidden treasure,
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Then you will understand how to fear the Lᴏʀᴅ,
>And you will discover knowledge about God.
###### 6

###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>To guard the paths of the righteous

###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>To deliver you from the way of the wicked,
>From those speaking perversity,
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>Who leave the upright paths
>To walk on the dark ways,
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>Who delight in doing evil,
>They rejoice in perverse evil;
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>Whose paths are morally crooked,
>And who are devious in their ways;
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>To deliver you from the adulterous woman,

###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>Who leaves the husband from her younger days,
>And has ignored her marriage covenant made before God.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>For she has set her house by death,

###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>None who go in to her will return,
>Nor will they reach the paths of life.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>So you will walk in the way of good people,

>And those with integrity will remain in it,
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>But the wicked will be removed from the land,
>And the treacherous will be torn away from it.
