## The Prophet Speaks
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Alas! The Lord has covered

>When he displayed his anger.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>The Lord destroyed mercilessly

###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>In fierce anger he destroyed

###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>He prepared his bow like an enemy;

###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>He destroyed his temple as if it were a vineyard;

>In his fierce anger he has spurned
>Both king and priest.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>The Lord rejected his altar

###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>My eyes are worn out from weeping;

>In the town squares.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Children say to their mothers,

###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>With what can I equate you?
>To what can I compare you, O Daughter Jerusalem?
>To what can I liken you
>So that I might comfort you, O Virgin Daughter Zion?
>Your wound is as deep as the sea.
>Who can heal you?
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>Your prophets saw visions for you

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We have lived to see it!”
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ has done what he planned;
>He has fulfilled his promise
>That he threatened long ago:
>He has overthrown you without mercy
>And has enabled the enemy to gloat over you;
>He has exalted your adversaries’ power.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>Cry out from your heart to the Lord,

## Jerusalem Speaks
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>Look, O Lord! Consider!
>Whom have you ever afflicted like this?

>Should priest and prophet
>Be killed in the Lord’s sanctuary?
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>The young boys and old men
