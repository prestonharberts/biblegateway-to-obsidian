## Elihu’s Third Speech
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Then Elihu answered:

###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do you think this to be just
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When you say, ‘My right before God’?
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But you say, ‘What will it profit you,’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And, ‘What do I gain by not sinning?’
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will reply to you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And to your friends with you.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Gaze at the heavens and see;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Consider the clouds, which are higher than you.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If you sin, how does it affect God?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If your transgressions are many,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>What does it do to him?
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If you are righteous, what do you give to God,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or what does he receive from your hand?
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your wickedness affects only a person like yourself,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And your righteousness only other people.

###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>People cry out
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because of the excess of oppression;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They cry out for help
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because of the power of the mighty.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But no one says, ‘Where is God, my Creator,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Who gives songs in the night,
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Who teaches us more than the wild animals of the earth,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?’
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then they cry out—but he does not answer—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because of the arrogance of the wicked.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Surely it is an empty cry—God does not hear it;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Almighty does not take notice of it.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How much less, then,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When you say that you do not perceive him,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That the case is before him
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And you are waiting for him!
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And further, when you say
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That his anger does not punish,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And that he does not know transgression!
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So Job opens his mouth to no purpose;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Without knowledge he multiplies words.”
