###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span> If only you would tear apart the sky and come down!
>The mountains would tremble before you!
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span> As when fire ignites dry wood,
>Or fire makes water boil,
>Let your adversaries know who you are,
>And may the nations shake at your presence!
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>When you performed awesome deeds that took us by surprise,
>You came down, and the mountains trembled before you.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>Since ancient times no one has heard or perceived,
>No eye has seen any God besides you,
>Who intervenes for those who wait for him.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>You assist those who delight in doing what is right,
>Who observe your commandments.
>Look, you were angry because we violated them continually.
>How then can we be saved?
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>We are all like one who is unclean,
>All our so-called righteous acts are like a menstrual rag in your sight.
>We all wither like a leaf;
>Our sins carry us away like the wind.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>No one invokes your name,
>Or makes an effort to take hold of you.
>For you have rejected us
>And handed us over to our own sins.

###### 8
><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span>Yet, Lᴏʀᴅ, you are our father.
>We are the clay, and you are our potter;
>We are all the product of your labor.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>Lᴏʀᴅ, do not be too angry!
>Do not hold our sins against us continually.
>Take a good look at your people, at all of us.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Your chosen cities have become a wilderness;
>Zion has become a wilderness,
>Jerusalem, a desolate ruin.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Our holy temple, our pride and joy,
>The place where our ancestors praised you,
>Has been burned with fire;
>All our prized possessions have been destroyed.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>In light of all this, how can you still hold back, Lᴏʀᴅ?
>How can you be silent and continue to humiliate us?
