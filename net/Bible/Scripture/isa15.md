## The Lord Will Judge Moab
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>This is an oracle about Moab:
>Indeed, in a night it is devastated,
>Ar of Moab is destroyed!
>Indeed, in a night it is devastated,
>Kir of Moab is destroyed!
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>They went up to the temple;
>The people of Dibon went up to the high places to lament.
>Because of what happened to Nebo and Medeba, Moab wails.
>Every head is shaved bare,
>Every beard is trimmed off.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>In their streets they wear sackcloth;
>On their roofs and in their town squares
>All of them wail;
>They fall down weeping.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>The people of Heshbon and Elealeh cry out;
>Their voices are heard as far away as Jahaz.
>For this reason Moab’s soldiers shout in distress;
>Their courage wavers.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>My heart cries out because of Moab’s plight,
>And for the fugitives stretched out as far as Zoar and Eglath Shelishiyah.
>For they weep as they make their way up the ascent of Luhith;
>They loudly lament their demise on the road to Horonaim.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>For the waters of Nimrim are gone;
>The grass is dried up,
>The vegetation has disappeared,
>And there are no plants.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>For this reason what they have made and stored up,
>They carry over the Stream of the Poplars.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Indeed, the cries of distress echo throughout Moabite territory;
>Their wailing can be heard in Eglaim and Beer Elim.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>Indeed, the waters of Dimon are full of blood!
>Indeed, I will heap even more trouble on Dimon.
>A lion will attack the Moabite fugitives
>And the people left in the land.
