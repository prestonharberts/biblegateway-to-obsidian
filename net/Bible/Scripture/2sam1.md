## David Learns of the Deaths of Saul and Jonathan
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>After the death of Saul, when David had returned from defeating the Amalekites, he stayed at Ziklag for two days.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>On the third day a man arrived from the camp of Saul with his clothes torn and dirt on his head. When he approached David, the man threw himself to the ground.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>David asked him, “Where are you coming from?” He replied, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.”
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>David inquired, “How were things going? Tell me!” He replied, “The people fled from the battle and many of them fell dead. Even Saul and his son Jonathan are dead!”
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>David said to the young man who was telling him this, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?”
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>The young man said, “I just happened to be on Mount Gilboa and came across Saul leaning on his spear for support. The chariots and leaders of the horsemen were in hot pursuit of him.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me. I answered, ‘Here I am!’
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>“He asked me, ‘Who are you?’ I told him, ‘I’m an Amalekite.’
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>“He said to me, ‘Stand over me and finish me off! I’m very dizzy, even though I’m still alive.’
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“So I stood over him and put him to death, since I knew that he couldn’t live in such a condition. Then I took the crown which was on his head and the bracelet which was on his arm. I have brought them here to my lord.”

###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>David then grabbed his own clothes and tore them, as did all the men who were with him.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>They lamented and wept and fasted until evening because Saul, his son Jonathan, the Lᴏʀᴅ’s army, and the house of Israel had fallen by the sword.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>David said to the young man who told this to him, “Where are you from?” He replied, “I am an Amalekite, the son of a resident foreigner.”
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>David replied to him, “How is it that you were not afraid to reach out your hand to destroy the Lᴏʀᴅ’s anointed?”
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>Then David called one of the soldiers and said, “Come here and strike him down!” So he struck him down, and he died.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>David said to him, “Your blood be on your own head! Your own mouth has testified against you, saying ‘I have put the Lᴏʀᴅ’s anointed to death.’”
## David’s Tribute to Saul and Jonathan
###### 17
<span class=verse-first>17</span>Then David chanted this lament over Saul and his son Jonathan.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>(He gave instructions that the people of Judah should be taught “The Bow.” Indeed, it is written down in the Scroll of the Upright One.)

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Don’t spread the news in the streets of Ashkelon,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or the daughters of the Philistines will rejoice,

###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>O mountains of Gilboa,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>May there be no dew or rain on you, nor fields of grain offerings!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For it was there that the shield of warriors was defiled;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The shield of Saul lies neglected without oil.

><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Saul and Jonathan were greatly loved during their lives,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And not even in their deaths were they separated.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They were swifter than eagles, stronger than lions.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who clothed you in scarlet as well as jewelry,
