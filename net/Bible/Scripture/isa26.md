## Judah Will Celebrate
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>At that time this song will be sung in the land of Judah:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We have a strong city!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ’s deliverance, like walls and a rampart, makes it secure.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Open the gates so a righteous nation can enter—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>One that remains trustworthy.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You keep completely safe the people who maintain their faith,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For they trust in you.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Trust in the Lᴏʀᴅ from this time forward,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even in Yᴀʜ, the Lᴏʀᴅ, an enduring protector!
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, the Lᴏʀᴅ knocks down those who live in a high place,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He brings down an elevated town;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He brings it down to the ground,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He throws it down to the dust.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It is trampled underfoot
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>By the feet of the oppressed,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>By the soles of the poor.”
## God’s People Anticipate Vindication
###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span>The way of the righteous is level,
>The path of the righteous that you prepare is straight.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Yes, as your judgments unfold,
>O Lᴏʀᴅ, we wait for you.
>We desire your fame and reputation to grow.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>I look for you during the night;
>My spirit within me seeks you at dawn,
>For when your judgments come upon the earth,
>Those who live in the world learn about justice.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>If the wicked are shown mercy,
>They do not learn about justice.
>Even in a land where right is rewarded, they act unjustly;
>They do not see the Lᴏʀᴅ’s majesty revealed.

###### 11
><span class=verse-first-poetry>11</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ, you are ready to act,
>But they don’t even notice.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will see and be put to shame by your angry judgment against humankind;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yes, fire will consume your enemies.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ, you make us secure,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For even all we have accomplished, you have done for us.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ, our God,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Masters other than you have ruled us,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But we praise your name alone.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The dead do not come back to life,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The spirits of the dead do not rise.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That is because you came in judgment and destroyed them,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You wiped out all memory of them.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You have made the nation larger, O Lᴏʀᴅ;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You have made the nation larger and revealed your splendor;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You have extended all the borders of the land.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ, in distress they looked for you;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They uttered incantations because of your discipline.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As when a pregnant woman gets ready to deliver
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And strains and cries out because of her labor pains,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So were we because of you, O Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We were pregnant, we strained,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We gave birth, as it were, to wind.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We cannot produce deliverance on the earth;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No people are born to populate the world.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your dead will come back to life;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your corpses will rise up.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Wake up and shout joyfully, you who live in the ground!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For you will grow like plants drenched with the morning dew,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the earth will bring forth its dead spirits.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 20
><span class=verse-first-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Go, my people! Enter your inner rooms!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Close your doors behind you!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Hide for a little while,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Until his angry judgment is over.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For look, the Lᴏʀᴅ is coming out of the place where he lives,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To punish the sin of those who live on the earth.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The earth will display the blood shed on it;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will no longer cover up its slain.
