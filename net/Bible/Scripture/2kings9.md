## Jehu Becomes King
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Now Elisha the prophet summoned a member of the prophetic guild and told him, “Tuck your robes into your belt, take this container of olive oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth Gilead.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“When you arrive there, look for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat son of Nimshi and take him aside into an inner room.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“Take the container of olive oil, pour it over his head, and say, ‘This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ has said, “I have designated you as king over Israel.”’ Then open the door and run away quickly!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 4
<span class=verse-first>4</span>So the young prophet went to Ramoth Gilead.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>When he arrived, the officers of the army were sitting there. So he said, “I have a message for you, O officer.” Jehu asked, “For which one of us?” He replied, “For you, O officer.”
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>So Jehu got up and went inside. Then the prophet poured the olive oil on his head and said to him, “This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ God of Israel has said, ‘I have designated you as king over the Lᴏʀᴅ’s people Israel.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>‘You will destroy the family of your master Ahab. I will get revenge against Jezebel for the shed blood of my servants the prophets and for the shed blood of all the Lᴏʀᴅ’s servants.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>‘Ahab’s entire family will die. I will cut off every last male belonging to Ahab in Israel, including even the weak and incapacitated.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>‘I will make Ahab’s dynasty like those of Jeroboam son of Nebat and Baasha son of Ahijah.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>‘Dogs will devour Jezebel on the plot of ground in Jezreel; she will not be buried.’” Then he opened the door and ran away.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>When Jehu rejoined his master’s servants, they asked him, “Is everything all right? Why did this madman visit you?” He replied, “Ah, it’s not important. You know what kind of man he is and the kinds of things he says.”
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>But they said, “You’re lying! Tell us what he said.” So he told them what he had said. He also related how he had said, “This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ has said, ‘I have designated you as king over Israel.’”
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>Each of them quickly took off his cloak, and they spread them out at Jehu’s feet on the steps. The trumpet was blown and they shouted, “Jehu is king!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
<span class=verse-first>14</span>Then Jehu son of Jehoshaphat son of Nimshi conspired against Joram.
## Jehu the Assassin
Now Joram had been in Ramoth Gilead with the whole Israelite army, guarding against an invasion by King Hazael of Syria.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>But King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he received from the Syrians when he fought against King Hazael of Syria. Jehu told his supporters, “If you really want me to be king, then don’t let anyone escape from the city to go and warn Jezreel.”
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>Jehu drove his chariot to Jezreel, for Joram was recuperating there. (Now King Ahaziah of Judah had come down to visit Joram.)
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
<span class=verse-first>17</span>Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel and saw Jehu’s troops approaching. He said, “I see troops!” Joram ordered, “Send a rider out to meet them and have him ask, ‘Is everything all right?’”
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>So the horseman went to meet him and said, “This is what the king says, ‘Is everything all right?’” Jehu replied, “None of your business! Follow me.” The watchman reported, “The messenger reached them, but hasn’t started back.”
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>So he sent a second horseman out to them and he said, “This is what the king says, ‘Is everything all right?’” Jehu replied, “None of your business! Follow me.”
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>The watchman reported, “He reached them, but hasn’t started back. The one who drives the lead chariot drives like Jehu son of Nimshi; he drives recklessly.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 21
<span class=verse-first>21</span>Joram ordered, “Hitch up my chariot.” When his chariot had been hitched up, King Joram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah went out in their respective chariots to meet Jehu. They met up with him in the plot of land that had once belonged to Naboth of Jezreel.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>When Joram saw Jehu, he asked, “Is everything all right, Jehu?” He replied, “How can everything be all right as long as your mother Jezebel promotes idolatry and pagan practices?”
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>Joram turned his chariot around and took off. He said to Ahaziah, “It’s a trap, Ahaziah!”
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>Jehu aimed his bow and shot an arrow right between Joram’s shoulders. The arrow went through his heart and he fell to his knees in his chariot.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>Jehu ordered his officer Bidkar, “Pick him up and throw him into the part of the field that once belonged to Naboth of Jezreel. Remember, you and I were riding together behind his father, Ahab, when the Lᴏʀᴅ pronounced this oracle against him,
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>‘“Know for sure that I saw the shed blood of Naboth and his sons yesterday,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ, “and that I will give you what you deserve right here in this plot of land,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.’ So now pick him up and throw him into this plot of land, just as in the Lᴏʀᴅ’s message.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 27
<span class=verse-first>27</span>When King Ahaziah of Judah saw what happened, he took off up the road to Beth Haggan. Jehu chased him and ordered, “Shoot him too.” They shot him while he was driving his chariot up the ascent of Gur near Ibleam. He fled to Megiddo and died there.
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>His servants took his body back to Jerusalem and buried him in his tomb with his ancestors in the City of David.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 29
<span class=verse-first>29</span>Ahaziah had become king over Judah in the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 30
<span class=verse-first>30</span>Jehu approached Jezreel. When Jezebel heard the news, she put on some eye liner, fixed up her hair, and leaned out the window.
###### 31
<span class=verse-body>31</span>When Jehu came through the gate, she said, “Is everything all right, Zimri, murderer of his master?”
###### 32
<span class=verse-body>32</span>He looked up at the window and said, “Who is on my side? Who?” Two or three eunuchs looked down at him.
###### 33
<span class=verse-body>33</span>He said, “Throw her down!” So they threw her down, and when she hit the ground, her blood splattered against the wall and the horses, and Jehu drove his chariot over her.
###### 34
<span class=verse-body>34</span>He went inside and had a meal. Then he said, “Dispose of this accursed woman’s corpse. Bury her, for after all, she was a king’s daughter.”
###### 35
<span class=verse-body>35</span>But when they went to bury her, they found nothing left but the skull, feet, and palms of the hands.
###### 36
<span class=verse-body>36</span>So they went back and told him. Then he said, “It is the fulfillment of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s message that he had spoken through his servant, Elijah the Tishbite, ‘In the plot of land at Jezreel, dogs will devour Jezebel’s flesh.
###### 37
<span class=verse-body>37</span>‘Jezebel’s corpse will be like manure on the surface of the ground in the plot of land at Jezreel. People will not be able to even recognize her.’”
