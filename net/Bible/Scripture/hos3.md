## An Illustration of God’s Love for Idolatrous Israel
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said to me, “Go, show love to your wife again, even though she loves another man and continually commits adultery. Likewise, the Lᴏʀᴅ loves the Israelites although they turn to other gods and love to offer raisin cakes to idols.”
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>So I paid fifteen shekels of silver and about seven bushels of barley to purchase her.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>Then I told her, “You must live with me many days; you must not commit adultery or become joined to another man, and I also will wait for you.”
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>For the Israelites must live many days without a king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred fertility pillar, without ephod or idols.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>Afterward, the Israelites will turn and seek the Lᴏʀᴅ their God and their Davidic king. Then they will submit to the Lᴏʀᴅ in fear and receive his blessings in future days.
