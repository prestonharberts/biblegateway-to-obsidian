###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>I saw the Lord standing by the altar and he said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Strike the tops of the support pillars, so the thresholds shake!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Knock them down on the heads of all the people,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I will kill the survivors with the sword.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No one will be able to run away;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No one will be able to escape.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even if they could dig down into the netherworld,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My hand would pull them up from there.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even if they could climb up to heaven,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I would drag them down from there.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even if they were to hide on the top of Mount Carmel,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I would hunt them down and take them from there.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even if they tried to hide from me at the bottom of the sea,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>From there I would command the Sea Serpent to bite them.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even when their enemies drive them into captivity,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>From there I will command the sword to kill them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will not let them out of my sight;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will experience disaster, not prosperity.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 5
><span class=verse-first-poetry>5</span>The Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies will do this.
>He touches the earth and it dissolves;
>All who live on it mourn.
>The whole earth rises like the Nile River,
>And then grows calm like the Nile in Egypt.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>He builds the upper rooms of his palace in heaven
>And sets its foundation supports on the earth.
>He summons the water of the sea
>And pours it out on the earth’s surface.
>The Lᴏʀᴅ is his name.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You Israelites are just like the Ethiopians in my sight,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Certainly I brought Israel up from the land of Egypt,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But I also brought the Philistines from Caphtor and the Arameans from Kir.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ is watching the sinful nation,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I will destroy it from the face of the earth.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But I will not completely destroy the family of Jacob,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For look, I am giving a command
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I will shake the family of Israel together with all the nations.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will resemble a sieve being shaken,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When not even a pebble falls to the ground.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All the sinners among my people will die by the sword—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The ones who say, ‘Disaster will not come near, it will not confront us.’”
## The Restoration of the Davidic Dynasty
###### 11
><span class=verse-first-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In that day I will rebuild the collapsing hut of David.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will seal its gaps,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Repair its ruins,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And restore it to what it was like in days gone by.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As a result they will conquer those left in Edom
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And all the nations subject to my rule.”
>The Lᴏʀᴅ, who is about to do this, is speaking.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Be sure of this, the time is coming,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When the plowman will catch up to the reaper,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the one who stomps the grapes will overtake the planter.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Juice will run down the slopes;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will flow down all the hillsides.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will bring back my people, Israel;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will rebuild the cities lying in rubble and settle down.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will plant vineyards and drink the wine they produce;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will grow orchards and eat the fruit they produce.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will plant them on their land,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And they will never again be uprooted from the land I have given them,”
>Says the Lᴏʀᴅ your God.
