## The Lord Will Judge Damascus
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>This is an oracle about Damascus:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, Damascus is no longer a city,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It is a heap of ruins!
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The cities of Aroer are abandoned.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will be used for herds,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Which will lie down there in peace.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Fortified cities will disappear from Ephraim,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And Damascus will lose its kingdom.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The survivors in Syria
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will end up like the splendor of the Israelites,”
>Says the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies.

###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>At that time
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Jacob’s splendor will be greatly diminished,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And he will become skin and bones.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will be as when one gathers the grain harvest,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And his hand gleans the ear of grain.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will be like one gathering the ears of grain
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In the Valley of Rephaim.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There will be some left behind,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As when an olive tree is beaten—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Two or three ripe olives remain toward the very top,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Four or five on its fruitful branches,”
>Says the Lᴏʀᴅ God of Israel.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>At that time men will trust in their Creator;
>They will depend on the Holy One of Israel.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>They will no longer trust in the altars their hands made,
>Or depend on the Asherah poles and incense altars their fingers made.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>At that time their fortified cities will be
>Like the abandoned summits of the Amorites,
>Which they abandoned because of the Israelites;
>There will be desolation.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>For you ignore the God who rescues you;
>You pay no attention to your strong protector.
>So this is what happens:
>You cultivate beautiful plants
>And plant exotic vines.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>The day you begin cultivating, you do what you can to make it grow;
>The morning you begin planting, you do what you can to make it sprout.
>Yet the harvest will disappear in the day of disease
>And incurable pain.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 12
><span class=verse-first-poetry>12</span>Beware, you many nations massing together,
>Those who make a commotion as loud as the roaring of the sea’s waves.
>Beware, you people making such an uproar,
>Those who make an uproar as loud as the roaring of powerful waves.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>Though these people make an uproar as loud as the roaring of powerful waves,
>When he shouts at them, they will flee to a distant land,
>Driven before the wind like dead weeds on the hills,
>Or like dead thistles before a strong gale.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>In the evening there is sudden terror;
>By morning they vanish.
>This is the fate of those who try to plunder us,
>The destiny of those who try to loot us!
