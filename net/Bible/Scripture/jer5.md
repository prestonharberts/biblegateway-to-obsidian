## Judah is Justly Deserving of Coming Judgment
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Go up and down through the streets of Jerusalem.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look around and see for yourselves.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Search through its public squares.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>See if any of you can find a single person
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who deals honestly and tries to be truthful.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If you can, then I will not punish this city.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>These people make promises in the name of the Lᴏʀᴅ.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But the fact is, what they swear to is really a lie.”
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Lᴏʀᴅ, I know you look for faithfulness.
>But even when you punish these people, they feel no remorse.
>Even when you nearly destroy them, they refuse to be corrected.
>They have become as hardheaded as a rock.
>They refuse to change their ways.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span>I thought, “Surely it is only the ignorant poor who act this way.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They act like fools because they do not know what the Lᴏʀᴅ demands.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They do not know what their God requires of them.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will go to the leaders
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And speak with them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Surely they know what the Lᴏʀᴅ demands.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Surely they know what their God requires of them.”
>Yet all of them, too, have rejected his authority
>And refuse to submit to him.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>So like a lion from the thicket their enemies will kill them.
>Like a wolf from the rift valley they will destroy them.
>Like a leopard they will lie in wait outside their cities
>And totally destroy anyone who ventures out.
>For they have rebelled so much
>And done so many unfaithful things.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
<span class=verse-first>7</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ asked,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How can I leave you unpunished, Jerusalem?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your people have rejected me
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And have worshiped gods that are not gods at all.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even though I supplied all their needs, they were like an unfaithful wife to me.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They went flocking to the houses of prostitutes.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are like lusty, well-fed stallions.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Each of them lusts after his neighbor’s wife.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will surely punish them for doing such things!” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will surely bring retribution on such a nation as this!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
><span class=verse-first-poetry>10</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ commanded the enemy,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>March through the vineyards of Israel and Judah and ruin them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But do not destroy them completely.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Strip off their branches
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For these people do not belong to the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the nations of Israel and Judah
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Have been very unfaithful to me,”
>Says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>These people have denied what the Lᴏʀᴅ says.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They have said, ‘That is not so!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>No harm will come to us.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>We will not experience war and famine.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The prophets will prove to be full of wind.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ has not spoken through them.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>So, let what they say happen to them.’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
<span class=verse-first>14</span>Because of that, the Lᴏʀᴅ God of Heaven’s Armies said to me:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because these people have spoken like this,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will make the words that I put in your mouth like fire.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I will make this people like wood,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Which the fiery judgments you speak will burn up.”
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ says, “Listen, nation of Israel!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I am about to bring a nation from far away to attack you.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will be a nation that was founded long ago
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And has lasted for a long time.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will be a nation whose language you will not know.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Its people will speak words that you will not be able to understand.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All its soldiers are strong and mighty.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their arrows will send you to your grave.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will eat up your crops and your food.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will kill off your sons and your daughters.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will eat up your sheep and your cattle.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will destroy your vines and your fig trees.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their weapons will batter down
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The fortified cities you trust in.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span>“Yet even then I will not completely destroy you,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>“So then, Jeremiah, when your people ask, ‘Why has the Lᴏʀᴅ our God done all this to us?’ tell them, ‘It is because you rejected me and served foreign gods in your own land. So you must serve foreigners in a land that does not belong to you.’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 20
><span class=verse-first-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Proclaim this message among the descendants of Jacob.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Make it known throughout Judah.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Tell them: ‘Hear this,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You foolish people who have no understanding,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Who have eyes but do not discern,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Who have ears but do not perceive:
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You should fear me!’ says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You should tremble in awe before me!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I made the sand to be a boundary for the sea,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>A permanent barrier that it can never cross.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Its waves may roll, but they can never prevail.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They may roar, but they can never cross beyond that boundary.’
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But these people have stubborn and rebellious hearts.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They have turned aside and gone their own way.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They do not say to themselves,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Let us revere the Lᴏʀᴅ our God.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>It is he who gives us the autumn rains and the spring rains at the proper time.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>It is he who assures us of the regular weeks of harvest.”
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Your misdeeds have stopped these things from coming.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Your sins have deprived you of my bounty.’
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, there are wicked scoundrels among my people.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They lie in wait like bird catchers hiding in ambush.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They set deadly traps to catch people.
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a cage filled with the birds that have been caught,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their houses are filled with the gains of their fraud and deceit.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That is how they have gotten so rich and powerful.
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That is how they have grown fat and sleek.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There is no limit to the evil things they do.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They do not plead the cause of the fatherless in such a way as to win it.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They do not defend the rights of the poor.
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will certainly punish them for doing such things!” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will certainly bring retribution on such a nation as this!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 30
><span class=verse-first-poetry>30</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Something horrible and shocking
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is going on in the land of Judah:
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The prophets prophesy lies.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The priests exercise power by their own authority.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And my people love to have it this way.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But they will not be able to help you when the time of judgment comes!
