## Ministry in the Last Days
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>But understand this, that in the last days difficult times will come.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>For people will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy,
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>unloving, irreconcilable, slanderers, without self-control, savage, opposed to what is good,
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>treacherous, reckless, conceited, loving pleasure rather than loving God.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>They will maintain the outward appearance of religion but will have repudiated its power. So avoid people like these.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>For some of these insinuate themselves into households and captivate weak women who are overwhelmed with sins and led along by various passions.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>Such women are always seeking instruction, yet never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>And just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these people—who have warped minds and are disqualified in the faith—also oppose the truth.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>But they will not go much further, for their foolishness will be obvious to everyone, just like it was with Jannes and Jambres.
## Continue in What You Have Learned
###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>You, however, have followed my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, my endurance,
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>as well as the persecutions and sufferings that happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, and in Lystra. I endured these persecutions and the Lord delivered me from them all.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>Now in fact all who want to live godly lives in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.

###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>But evil people and charlatans will go from bad to worse, deceiving others and being deceived themselves.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
<span class=verse-first>14</span>You, however, must continue in the things you have learned and are confident about. You know who taught you
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>and how from infancy you have known the holy writings, which are able to give you wisdom for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>Every scripture is inspired by God and useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>that the person dedicated to God may be capable and equipped for every good work.
