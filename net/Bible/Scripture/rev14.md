## An Interlude: The Song of the 144,000
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Then I looked, and here was the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him were 144,000, who had his name and his Father’s name written on their foreheads.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>I also heard a sound coming out of heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder. Now the sound I heard was like that made by harpists playing their harps,
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>and they were singing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one was able to learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>These are the ones who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were redeemed from humanity as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb,
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>and no lie was found on their lips; they are blameless.
## Three Angels and Three Messages
###### 6
<span class=verse-first>6</span>Then I saw another angel flying directly overhead, and he had an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth—to every nation, tribe, language, and people.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>He declared in a loud voice: “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has arrived, and worship the one who made heaven and earth, the sea and the springs of water!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>A second angel followed the first, declaring: “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great city! She made all the nations drink of the wine of her immoral passion.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
<span class=verse-first>9</span>A third angel followed the first two, declaring in a loud voice: “If anyone worships the beast and his image, and takes the mark on his forehead or his hand,
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“that person will also drink of the wine of God’s anger that has been mixed undiluted in the cup of his wrath, and he will be tortured with fire and sulfur in front of the holy angels and in front of the Lamb.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>“And the smoke from their torture will go up forever and ever, and those who worship the beast and his image will have no rest day or night, along with anyone who receives the mark of his name.”
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>This requires the steadfast endurance of the saints—those who obey God’s commandments and hold to their faith in Jesus.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>Then I heard a voice from heaven say, “Write this:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Blessed are the dead,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Those who die in the Lord from this moment on!’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

“Yes,” says the Spirit, “so they can rest from their hard work, because their deeds will follow them.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
<span class=verse-first>14</span>Then I looked, and a white cloud appeared, and seated on the cloud was one like a son of man! He had a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>Then another angel came out of the temple, shouting in a loud voice to the one seated on the cloud, “Use your sickle and start to reap, because the time to reap has come, since the earth’s harvest is ripe!”
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>So the one seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was reaped.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
<span class=verse-first>17</span>Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>Another angel, who was in charge of the fire, came from the altar and called in a loud voice to the angel who had the sharp sickle, “Use your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes off the vine of the earth, because its grapes are now ripe.”
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>So the angel swung his sickle over the earth and gathered the grapes from the vineyard of the earth and tossed them into the great winepress of the wrath of God.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>Then the winepress was stomped outside the city, and blood poured out of the winepress up to the height of horses’ bridles for a distance of almost 200 miles.
