## The Lord Gives Solomon a Promise and a Warning
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>After Solomon finished building the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple, the royal palace, and all the other construction projects he had planned,
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>the Lᴏʀᴅ appeared to Solomon a second time, in the same way he had appeared to him at Gibeon.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said to him, “I have answered your prayer and your request for help that you made to me. I have consecrated this temple you built by making it my permanent home; I will be constantly present there.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“You must serve me with integrity and sincerity, just as your father David did. Do everything I commanded and obey my rules and regulations.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“Then I will allow your dynasty to rule over Israel permanently, just as I promised your father David, ‘You will not fail to have a successor on the throne of Israel.’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 6
<span class=verse-first>6</span>“But if you or your sons ever turn away from me, fail to obey the regulations and rules I instructed you to keep, and decide to serve and worship other gods,
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“then I will remove Israel from the land I have given them, I will abandon this temple I have consecrated with my presence, and Israel will be mocked and ridiculed among all the nations.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>“This temple will become a heap of ruins; everyone who passes by it will be shocked and will hiss out their scorn, saying, ‘Why did the Lᴏʀᴅ do this to this land and this temple?’
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>“Others will then answer, ‘Because they abandoned the Lᴏʀᴅ their God, who led their ancestors out of Egypt. They embraced other gods whom they worshiped and served. That is why the Lᴏʀᴅ has brought all this disaster down on them.’”
## Foreign Affairs and Building Projects
###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>After twenty years, during which Solomon built the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple and the royal palace,
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>King Solomon gave King Hiram of Tyre twenty towns in the region of Galilee, because Hiram had supplied Solomon with cedars, evergreens, and all the gold he wanted.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>When Hiram went out from Tyre to inspect the towns Solomon had given him, he was not pleased with them.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>Hiram asked, “Why did you give me these towns, my friend?” He called that area the region of Cabul, a name which it has retained to this day.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>Hiram had sent to the king 120 talents of gold.

###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>Here are the details concerning the work crews King Solomon conscripted to build the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple, his palace, the terrace, the wall of Jerusalem, and the cities of Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>(Pharaoh, king of Egypt, had attacked and captured Gezer. He burned it and killed the Canaanites who lived in the city. He gave it as a wedding present to his daughter, who had married Solomon.)
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>Solomon built up Gezer, lower Beth Horon,
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>Baalath, Tadmor in the wilderness,
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>all the storage cities that belonged to him, and the cities where chariots and horses were kept. He built whatever he wanted in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and throughout his entire kingdom.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>Now several non-Israelite peoples were left in the land after the conquest of Joshua, including the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>Their descendants remained in the land (the Israelites were unable to wipe them out completely). Solomon conscripted them for his work crews, and they continue in that role to this very day.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>Solomon did not assign Israelites to these work crews; the Israelites served as his soldiers, attendants, officers, charioteers, and commanders of his chariot forces.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 23
<span class=verse-first>23</span>These men were also in charge of Solomon’s work projects; there were a total of 550 men who supervised the workers.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 24
<span class=verse-first>24</span>Solomon built the terrace as soon as Pharaoh’s daughter moved up from the City of David to the palace Solomon built for her.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 25
<span class=verse-first>25</span>Three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar he had built for the Lᴏʀᴅ, burning incense along with them before the Lᴏʀᴅ. He made the temple his official worship place.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 26
<span class=verse-first>26</span>King Solomon also built ships in Ezion Geber, which is located near Elat in the land of Edom, on the shore of the Red Sea.
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>Hiram sent his fleet and some of his sailors, who were well acquainted with the sea, to serve with Solomon’s men.
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>They sailed to Ophir, took from there 420 talents of gold, and then brought them to King Solomon.
