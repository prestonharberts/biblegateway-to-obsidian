## Joshua Sends Home the Eastern Tribes
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>and told them: “You have carried out all the instructions of Moses the Lᴏʀᴅ’s servant, and you have obeyed all I have told you.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“You have not abandoned your fellow Israelites this entire time, right up to this very day. You have completed the task given you by the Lᴏʀᴅ your God.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“Now the Lᴏʀᴅ your God has made your fellow Israelites secure, just as he promised them. So now you may turn around and go to your homes in your own land that Moses the Lᴏʀᴅ’s servant assigned to you east of the Jordan.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“But carefully obey the commands and instructions Moses the Lᴏʀᴅ’s servant gave you. Love the Lᴏʀᴅ your God, follow all his instructions, obey his commands, be loyal to him, and serve him with all your heart and being!”
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>Joshua rewarded them and sent them on their way; they returned to their homes.

###### 7
<span class=verse-first>7</span>(Now to one half-tribe of Manasseh, Moses had assigned land in Bashan; and to the other half Joshua had assigned land on the west side of the Jordan with their fellow Israelites.) When Joshua sent them home, he rewarded them,
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>saying, “Take home great wealth, a lot of cattle, silver, gold, bronze, iron, and a lot of clothing. Divide up the goods captured from your enemies with your brothers.”
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>So the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh left the Israelites in Shiloh in the land of Canaan and headed home to their own land in Gilead, which they acquired by the Lᴏʀᴅ’s command through Moses.
## Civil War is Averted
###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh came to Geliloth near the Jordan in the land of Canaan and built there, near the Jordan, an impressive altar.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>The Israelites received this report: “Look, the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar at the entrance to the land of Canaan, at Geliloth near the Jordan on the Israelite side.”
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>When the Israelites heard this, the entire Israelite community assembled at Shiloh to launch an attack against them.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>The Israelites sent Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, to the land of Gilead to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>He was accompanied by ten leaders, one from each of the Israelite tribes, each one a family leader among the Israelite clans.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>They went to the land of Gilead to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, and said to them:
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>“The entire community of the Lᴏʀᴅ says, ‘Why have you disobeyed the God of Israel by turning back today from following the Lᴏʀᴅ? You built an altar for yourselves and have rebelled today against the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>‘The sin we committed at Peor was bad enough. To this very day we have not purified ourselves; it even brought a plague on the community of the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>‘Now today you dare to turn back from following the Lᴏʀᴅ! You are rebelling today against the Lᴏʀᴅ; tomorrow he may break out in anger against the entire community of Israel.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>‘But if your own land is impure, cross over to the Lᴏʀᴅ’s own land, where the Lᴏʀᴅ himself lives, and settle down among us. But don’t rebel against the Lᴏʀᴅ or us by building for yourselves an altar other than the altar of the Lᴏʀᴅ our God.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>“When Achan son of Zerah disobeyed the command about the city’s riches, the entire Israelite community was judged, though only one man had sinned. He most certainly died for his sin!’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 21
<span class=verse-first>21</span>The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered the leaders of the Israelite clans:
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>“El, God, the Lᴏʀᴅ! El, God, the Lᴏʀᴅ! He knows the truth! Israel must also know! If we have rebelled or disobeyed the Lᴏʀᴅ, don’t spare us today!
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>“If we have built an altar for ourselves to turn back from following the Lᴏʀᴅ by making burnt sacrifices and grain offerings on it, or by offering tokens of peace on it, the Lᴏʀᴅ himself will punish us.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>“We swear we have done this because we were worried that in the future your descendants would say to our descendants, ‘What relationship do you have with the Lᴏʀᴅ God of Israel?
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>‘The Lᴏʀᴅ made the Jordan a boundary between us and you Reubenites and Gadites. You have no right to worship the Lᴏʀᴅ.’ In this way your descendants might cause our descendants to stop obeying the Lᴏʀᴅ.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 26
<span class=verse-first>26</span>“So we decided to build this altar, not for burnt offerings and sacrifices,
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>“but as a reminder to us and you and our descendants who follow us, that we will honor the Lᴏʀᴅ in his very presence with burnt offerings, sacrifices, and tokens of peace. Then in the future your descendants will not be able to say to our descendants, ‘You have no right to worship the Lᴏʀᴅ.’
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>“We said, ‘If in the future they say such a thing to us or to our descendants, we will reply, “See the model of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s altar that our ancestors made, not for burnt offerings or sacrifices, but as a reminder to us and you.”’
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>“Far be it from us to rebel against the Lᴏʀᴅ by turning back today from following after the Lᴏʀᴅ by building an altar for burnt offerings, sacrifices, and tokens of peace aside from the altar of the Lᴏʀᴅ our God located in front of his dwelling place!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 30
<span class=verse-first>30</span>When Phinehas the priest and the community leaders and Israel’s clan leaders who accompanied him heard the defense of the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the Manassehites, they were satisfied.
###### 31
<span class=verse-body>31</span>Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, said to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the Manassehites, “Today we know that the Lᴏʀᴅ is among us, because you have not disobeyed the Lᴏʀᴅ in this. Now you have rescued the Israelites from the Lᴏʀᴅ’s judgment.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 32
<span class=verse-first>32</span>Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, and the leaders left the Reubenites and Gadites in the land of Gilead and reported back to the Israelites in the land of Canaan.
###### 33
<span class=verse-body>33</span>The Israelites were satisfied with their report and gave thanks to God. They said nothing more about launching an attack to destroy the land in which the Reubenites and Gadites lived.
###### 34
<span class=verse-body>34</span>The Reubenites and Gadites named the altar, “Surely it is a Reminder to us that the Lᴏʀᴅ is God.”
