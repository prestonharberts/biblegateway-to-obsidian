## The Victorious Divine Warrior
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Who is this who comes from Edom,
>Dressed in bright red, coming from Bozrah?
>Who is this one wearing royal attire,
>Who marches confidently because of his great strength?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It is I, the one who announces vindication,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And who is able to deliver!”
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Why are your clothes red?
>Why do you look like someone who has stomped on grapes in a vat?
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have stomped grapes in the winepress all by myself;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No one from the nations joined me.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I stomped on them in my anger;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I trampled them down in my rage.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their juice splashed on my garments,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And stained all my clothes.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I looked forward to the day of vengeance,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And then payback time arrived.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I looked, but there was no one to help;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I was shocked because there was no one offering support.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So my right arm accomplished deliverance;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My raging anger drove me on.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I trampled nations in my anger;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I made them drunk in my rage;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I splashed their blood on the ground.”
## A Prayer for Divine Intervention
###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span>I will tell of the faithful acts of the Lᴏʀᴅ,
>Of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s praiseworthy deeds.
>I will tell about all the Lᴏʀᴅ did for us,
>The many good things he did for the family of Israel,
>Because of his compassion and great faithfulness.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>He said, “Certainly they will be my people,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Children who are not disloyal.”
>He became their deliverer.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>Through all that they suffered, he suffered too.
>The messenger sent from his very presence delivered them.
>In his love and mercy he protected them;
>He lifted them up and carried them throughout ancient times.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>But they rebelled and offended his holy Spirit,
>So he turned into an enemy
>And fought against them.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>His people remembered the ancient times.
>Where is the one who brought them up out of the sea,
>Along with the shepherd of his flock?
>Where is the one who placed his holy Spirit among them,
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>The one who made his majestic power available to Moses,
>Who divided the water before them,
>Gaining for himself a lasting reputation,
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>Who led them through the deep water?
>Like a horse running through the wilderness they did not stumble.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>As an animal that goes down into a valley to graze,
>So the Spirit of the Lᴏʀᴅ granted them rest.
>In this way you guided your people,
>Gaining for yourself an honored reputation.

###### 15
><span class=verse-first-poetry>15</span>Look down from heaven and take notice,
>From your holy, majestic palace!
>Where are your zeal and power?
>Do not hold back your tender compassion!
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>For you are our father,
>Though Abraham does not know us
>And Israel does not recognize us.
>You, Lᴏʀᴅ, are our father;
>You have been called our Protector from ancient times.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>Why, Lᴏʀᴅ, do you make us stray from your ways,
>And make our minds stubborn so that we do not obey you?
>Return for the sake of your servants,
>The tribes of your inheritance!
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>For a short time your special nation possessed a land,
>But then our adversaries knocked down your holy sanctuary.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>We existed from ancient times,
>But you did not rule over them;
>They were not your subjects.
