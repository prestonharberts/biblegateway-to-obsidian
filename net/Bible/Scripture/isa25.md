###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ, you are my God!
>I will exalt you in praise, I will extol your fame.
>For you have done extraordinary things,
>And executed plans made long ago exactly as you decreed.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Indeed, you have made the city into a heap of rubble,
>The fortified town into a heap of ruins;
>The fortress of foreigners is no longer a city,
>It will never be rebuilt.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>So a strong nation will extol you;
>The towns of powerful nations will fear you.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>For you are a protector for the poor,
>A protector for the needy in their distress,
>A shelter from the rainstorm,
>A shade from the heat.
>Though the breath of tyrants is like a winter rainstorm,
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Like heat in a dry land,
>You humble the boasting foreigners.
>Just as the shadow of a cloud causes the heat to subside,
>So he causes the song of tyrants to cease.

###### 6
><span class=verse-first-poetry>6</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies will hold a banquet for all the nations on this mountain.
>At this banquet there will be plenty of meat and aged wine—
>Tender meat and choicest wine.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>On this mountain he will swallow up
>The shroud that is over all the peoples,
>The woven covering that is over all the nations;
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>He will swallow up death permanently.
>The Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ will wipe away the tears from every face,
>And remove his people’s disgrace from all the earth.
>Indeed, the Lᴏʀᴅ has announced it!
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>At that time they will say,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, here is our God!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We waited for him, and he delivered us.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Here is the Lᴏʀᴅ! We waited for him.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let’s rejoice and celebrate his deliverance!”
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ’s power will make this mountain secure.
>Moab will be trampled down where it stands,
>As a heap of straw is trampled down in a manure pile.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Moab will spread out its hands in the middle of it,
>Just as a swimmer spreads his hands to swim;
>The Lᴏʀᴅ will bring down Moab’s pride as it spreads its hands.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>The fortified city (along with the very tops of your walls) he will knock down,
>He will bring it down, he will throw it down to the dusty ground.
