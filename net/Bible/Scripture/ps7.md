><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ my God, in you I have taken shelter.
>Deliver me from all who chase me. Rescue me!
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Otherwise they will rip me to shreds like a lion;
>They will tear me to bits and no one will be able to rescue me.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 3
><span class=verse-first-poetry>3</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ my God, if I have done what they say,
>Or am guilty of unjust actions,
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>Or have wronged my ally,
>Or helped his lawless enemy,
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>May an enemy relentlessly chase me and catch me;
>May he trample me to death
>And leave me lying dishonored in the dust. (Selah)

###### 6
><span class=verse-first-poetry>6</span>Stand up angrily, Lᴏʀᴅ.
>Rise up with raging fury against my enemies.
>Wake up for my sake, and execute the judgment you have decreed for them.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>The countries are assembled all around you;
>Take once more your rightful place over them.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ judges the nations.
>Vindicate me, Lᴏʀᴅ, because I am innocent,
>Because I am blameless, O Exalted One.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>May the evil deeds of the wicked come to an end.
>But make the innocent secure,
>O righteous God,
>You who examine inner thoughts and motives.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>The Exalted God is my shield,
>The one who delivers the morally upright.

###### 12

>He has prepared to shoot his bow.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>He has prepared deadly weapons to use against him;
>He gets ready to shoot flaming arrows.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>See the one who is pregnant with wickedness,
>Who conceives destructive plans,
>And gives birth to harmful lies—
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>He digs a pit
>And then falls into the hole he has made.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>He becomes the victim of his own destructive plans—
>And the violence he intended for others falls on his own head.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
><span class=verse-first-poetry>17</span>I will thank the Lᴏʀᴅ for his justice;
>I will sing praises to the Lᴏʀᴅ Most High!
