###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>I will sing continually about the Lᴏʀᴅ’s faithful deeds;
>To future generations I will proclaim your faithfulness.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>For I say, “Loyal love is permanently established;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In the skies you set up your faithfulness.”
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have made a covenant with my chosen one;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have made a promise on oath to David, my servant:
###### 4

###### 5
><span class=verse-first-poetry>5</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ, the heavens praise your amazing deeds,
>As well as your faithfulness in the angelic assembly.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>For who in the skies can compare to the Lᴏʀᴅ?
>Who is like the Lᴏʀᴅ among the heavenly beings,
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>A God who is honored in the great angelic assembly,
>And more awesome than all who surround him?
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ God of Heaven’s Armies!
>Who is strong like you, O Lᴏʀᴅ?
>Your faithfulness surrounds you.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>You rule over the proud sea.
>When its waves surge, you calm them.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>You crushed the Proud One and killed it;
>With your strong arm you scattered your enemies.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
><span class=verse-first-poetry>11</span>The heavens belong to you, as does the earth.
>You made the world and all it contains.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>You created the north and the south.
>Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>Your arm is powerful,
>Your hand strong,
>Your right hand victorious.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>Equity and justice are the foundation of your throne.
>Loyal love and faithfulness characterize your rule.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>How blessed are the people who worship you!
>O Lᴏʀᴅ, they experience your favor.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>They rejoice in your name all day long,
>And are vindicated by your justice.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>For you give them splendor and strength.
>By your favor we are victorious.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>For our shield belongs to the Lᴏʀᴅ,
>Our king to the Holy One of Israel.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 19
><span class=verse-first-poetry>19</span>Then you spoke through a vision to your faithful followers and said:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have placed a young hero over a warrior;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have raised up a young man from the people.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have discovered David, my servant.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>With my holy oil I have anointed him as king.

><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My hand will support him,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And my arm will strengthen him.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No enemy will be able to exact tribute from him;

###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will crush his enemies before him;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will strike down those who hate him.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will experience my faithfulness and loyal love,

###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will place his hand over the sea,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His right hand over the rivers.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will call out to me,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You are my father, my God, and the protector who delivers me.’
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will appoint him to be my firstborn son,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The most exalted of the earth’s kings.
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will always extend my loyal love to him,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And my covenant with him is secure.
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will give him an eternal dynasty,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And make his throne as enduring as the skies above.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 30
><span class=verse-first-poetry>30</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If his sons reject my law
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And disobey my regulations,
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If they break my rules
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And do not keep my commandments,
###### 32
><span class=verse-body-poetry>32</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will punish their rebellion by beating them with a club,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their sin by inflicting them with bruises.
###### 33
><span class=verse-body-poetry>33</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But I will not remove my loyal love from him,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Nor be unfaithful to my promise.
###### 34
><span class=verse-body-poetry>34</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will not break my covenant
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or go back on what I promised.
###### 35
><span class=verse-body-poetry>35</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Once and for all I have vowed by my own holiness,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will never deceive David.
###### 36
><span class=verse-body-poetry>36</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His dynasty will last forever.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His throne will endure before me, like the sun;
###### 37
><span class=verse-body-poetry>37</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will remain stable, like the moon.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His throne will endure like the skies.” (Selah)
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 38
><span class=verse-first-poetry>38</span>But you have spurned and rejected him;
>You are angry with your chosen king.
###### 39
><span class=verse-body-poetry>39</span>You have repudiated your covenant with your servant;
>You have thrown his crown to the ground.
###### 40
><span class=verse-body-poetry>40</span>You have broken down all his walls;
>You have made his strongholds a heap of ruins.
###### 41
><span class=verse-body-poetry>41</span>All who pass by have robbed him;
>He has become an object of disdain to his neighbors.
###### 42
><span class=verse-body-poetry>42</span>You have allowed his adversaries to be victorious,
>And all his enemies to rejoice.
###### 43
><span class=verse-body-poetry>43</span>You turn back his sword from the adversary,
>And have not sustained him in battle.
###### 44
><span class=verse-body-poetry>44</span>You have brought to an end his splendor,
>And have knocked his throne to the ground.
###### 45
><span class=verse-body-poetry>45</span>You have cut short his youth,
>And have covered him with shame. (Selah)
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 46
><span class=verse-first-poetry>46</span>How long, O Lᴏʀᴅ, will this last?
>Will you remain hidden forever?
>Will your anger continue to burn like fire?
###### 47
><span class=verse-body-poetry>47</span>Take note of my brief lifespan.
>Why do you make all people so mortal?
###### 48
><span class=verse-body-poetry>48</span>No man can live on without experiencing death,
>Or deliver his life from the power of Sheol. (Selah)
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 49
><span class=verse-first-poetry>49</span>Where are your earlier faithful deeds, O Lord,
>The ones performed in accordance with your reliable oath to David?
###### 50
><span class=verse-body-poetry>50</span>Take note, O Lord, of the way your servants are taunted,
>And of how I must bear so many insults from people.
###### 51
><span class=verse-body-poetry>51</span>Your enemies, O Lᴏʀᴅ, hurl insults;
>They insult your chosen king as they dog his footsteps.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 52
><span class=verse-first-poetry>52</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ deserves praise forevermore!
>We agree! We agree!
