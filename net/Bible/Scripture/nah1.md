## Introduction
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>This is an oracle about Nineveh; the book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite:
## God Takes Vengeance against His Enemies
###### 2
><span class=verse-first-poetry>2</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ is a zealous and avenging God;
>The Lᴏʀᴅ is avenging and very angry.
>The Lᴏʀᴅ takes vengeance against his foes;
>He sustains his rage against his enemies.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ is slow to anger but great in power;
>The Lᴏʀᴅ will certainly not allow the wicked to go unpunished.
## The Divine Warrior Destroys His Enemies but Protects His People
>He marches out in the whirlwind and the raging storm;
>Dark storm clouds billow like dust under his feet.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>He shouts a battle cry against the sea and makes it dry up;
>He makes all the rivers run dry.
>Bashan and Carmel wither;
>The blossom of Lebanon withers.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>The mountains tremble before him,
>The hills convulse;
>The earth is laid waste before him,
>The world and all its inhabitants are laid waste.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>No one can withstand his indignation!
>No one can resist his fierce anger!
>His wrath is poured out like volcanic fire,
>Boulders are broken up as he approaches.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ is good—
>Indeed, he is a fortress in time of distress,
>And he protects those who seek refuge in him.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>But with an overwhelming flood
>He will make a complete end of Nineveh;
>He will drive his enemies into darkness.
## Denunciation and Destruction of Nineveh
###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span>Whatever you plot against the Lᴏʀᴅ, he will completely destroy!
>Distress will not arise a second time.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Surely they will be totally consumed
>Like entangled thorn bushes,
>Like the drink of drunkards,
>Like very dry stubble.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>From you, O Nineveh, one has marched forth who plots evil against the Lᴏʀᴅ,
>A wicked military strategist.
## Oracle of Deliverance to Judah
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even though they are powerful—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And what is more, even though their army is numerous—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Nevertheless, they will be destroyed and trickle away!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Although I afflicted you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will afflict you no more.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And now, I will break Assyria’s yoke bar from your neck;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will tear apart the shackles that are on you.”
## Oracle of Judgment against the King of Nineveh
###### 14
><span class=verse-first-poetry>14</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ has issued a decree against you:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your dynasty will come to an end.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will destroy the idols and images in the temples of your gods.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will desecrate your grave, because you are accursed!”
## Proclamation of the Deliverance of Judah
###### 15
><span class=verse-first-poetry>15</span> Look! A herald is running on the mountains!
>A messenger is proclaiming deliverance:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Celebrate your sacred festivals, O Judah!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Fulfill your sacred vows to praise God!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For never again will the wicked Assyrians invade you;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They have been completely destroyed.”
