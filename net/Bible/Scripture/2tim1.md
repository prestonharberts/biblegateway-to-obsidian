## Thanksgiving and Charge to Timothy
###### 3
<span class=verse-first>3</span>I am thankful to God, whom I have served with a clear conscience as my ancestors did, when I remember you in my prayers as I do constantly night and day.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>As I remember your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>I recall your sincere faith that was alive first in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice, and I am sure is in you.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>Because of this I remind you to rekindle God’s gift that you possess through the laying on of my hands.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>For God did not give us a Spirit of fear but of power and love and self-control.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or of me, a prisoner for his sake, but by God’s power accept your share of suffering for the gospel.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>He is the one who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not based on our works but on his own purpose and grace, granted to us in Christ Jesus before time began,
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>but now made visible through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus. He has broken the power of death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel!
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>For this gospel I was appointed a preacher and apostle and teacher.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>Because of this, in fact, I suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, because I know the one in whom my faith is set and I am convinced that he is able to protect what has been entrusted to me until that day.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>Hold to the standard of sound words that you heard from me and do so with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>Protect that good thing entrusted to you, through the Holy Spirit who lives within us.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>You know that everyone in the province of Asia deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>May the Lord grant mercy to the family of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my imprisonment.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>But when he arrived in Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>May the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that day! And you know very well all the ways he served me in Ephesus.
