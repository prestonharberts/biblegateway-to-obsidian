## Everyone Will Die
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>So I reflected on all this, attempting to clear it all up.
>I concluded that the righteous and the wise, as well as their works, are in the hand of God;
>Whether a person will be loved or hated—
>No one knows what lies ahead.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 2
><span class=verse-first-poetry>2</span>Everyone shares the same fate—
>The righteous and the wicked,
>The good and the bad,
>The ceremonially clean and unclean,
>Those who offer sacrifices and those who do not.
>What happens to the good person, also happens to the sinner;
>What happens to those who make vows, also happens to those who are afraid to make vows.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>This is the unfortunate fact about everything that happens on earth:
>The same fate awaits everyone.
>In addition to this, the hearts of all people are full of evil,
>And there is folly in their hearts during their lives—then they die.
## Better to Be Poor but Alive than Rich but Dead
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>But whoever is among the living has hope;
>A live dog is better than a dead lion.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>For the living know that they will die, but the dead do not know anything;
>They have no further reward—and even the memory of them disappears.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>What they loved, as well as what they hated and envied, perished long ago,
>And they no longer have a part in anything that happens on earth.
## Life is Brief, so Cherish its Joys
###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span>Go, eat your food with joy,
>And drink your wine with a happy heart,
>Because God has already approved your works.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Let your clothes always be white,
>And do not spare precious ointment on your head.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>Enjoy life with your beloved wife during all the days of your fleeting life
>That God has given you on earth during all your fleeting days;
>For that is your reward in life and in your burdensome work on earth.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
><span class=verse-first-poetry>10</span>Whatever you find to do with your hands,
>Do it with all your might,
>Because there is neither work nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave,
>The place where you will eventually go.
## Wisdom Cannot Protect against Seemingly Chance Events
###### 11
><span class=verse-first-poetry>11</span>Again, I observed this on the earth:
>The race is not always won by the swiftest,
>The battle is not always won by the strongest;
>Prosperity does not always belong to those who are the wisest,
>Wealth does not always belong to those who are the most discerning,
>Nor does success always come to those with the most knowledge—
>For time and chance may overcome them all.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Surely, no one knows his appointed time.
>Like fish that are caught in a deadly net, and like birds that are caught in a snare—
>Just like them, all people are ensnared at an unfortunate time that falls upon them suddenly.
## Most People Are Not Receptive to Wise Counsel
###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span>This is what I also observed about wisdom on earth,
>And it is a great burden to me:
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>There was once a small city with a few men in it,
>And a mighty king attacked it, besieging it and building strong siege works against it.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>However, a poor but wise man lived in the city,
>And he could have delivered the city by his wisdom,
>But no one listened to that poor man.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>So I concluded that wisdom is better than might,
>But a poor man’s wisdom is despised; no one ever listens to his advice.
## Wisdom versus Fools, Sin, and Folly
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>The words of the wise are heard in quiet,
>More than the shouting of a ruler is heard among fools.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>Wisdom is better than weapons of war,
>But one sinner can destroy much that is good.
