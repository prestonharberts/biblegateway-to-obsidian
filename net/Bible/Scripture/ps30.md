>Give thanks to his holy name.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>For his anger lasts only a brief moment,

###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>What profit is there in taking my life,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In my descending into the Pit?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Can the dust of the grave praise you?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Can it declare your loyalty?

><span class=verse-first-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Hear, O Lᴏʀᴅ, and have mercy on me.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ, deliver me.”

><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Then you turned my lament into dancing;
>You removed my sackcloth and covered me with joy.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>So now my heart will sing to you and not be silent;
>O Lᴏʀᴅ my God, I will always give thanks to you.
