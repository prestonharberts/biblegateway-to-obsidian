## The Land and Its People Are Transformed
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Let the wilderness and desert be happy;
>Let the arid rift valley rejoice and bloom like a lily!
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Let it richly bloom;
>Let it rejoice and shout with delight!
>It is given the grandeur of Lebanon,
>The splendor of Carmel and Sharon.
>They will see the grandeur of the Lᴏʀᴅ,
>The splendor of our God.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Strengthen the hands that have gone limp,
>Steady the knees that shake.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>Tell those who panic,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Be strong! Do not fear!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, your God comes to avenge;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>With divine retribution he comes to deliver you.”
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Then blind eyes will open,
>Deaf ears will hear.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Then the lame will leap like a deer,
>The mute tongue will shout for joy;
>For water will burst forth in the wilderness,
>Streams in the arid rift valley.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>The dry soil will become a pool of water,
>The parched ground springs of water.
>Where jackals once lived and sprawled out,
>Grass, reeds, and papyrus will grow.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>A thoroughfare will be there—
>It will be called the Way of Holiness.
>The unclean will not travel on it;
>It is reserved for those authorized to use it—
>Fools will not stray into it.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>No lions will be there,
>No ferocious wild animals will be on it—
>They will not be found there.
>Those delivered from bondage will travel on it,
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Those whom the Lᴏʀᴅ has ransomed will return that way.
>They will enter Zion with a happy shout.
>Unending joy will crown them,
>Happiness and joy will overwhelm them;
>Grief and suffering will disappear.
