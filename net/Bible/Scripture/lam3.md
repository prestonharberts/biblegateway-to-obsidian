## The Prophet Speaks
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>I am the man who has experienced affliction
>From the rod of theLᴏʀᴅ’s wrath.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>He drove me into captivity and made me walk
>In darkness and not light.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>He repeatedly attacks me;
>He turns his hand against me all day long.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>He has made my mortal skin waste away;
>He has broken my bones.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>He has besieged and surrounded me
>With bitter hardship.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>He has made me reside in deepest darkness
>Like those who died long ago.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>He has walled me in so that I cannot get out;
>He has weighted me down with heavy prison chains.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Also, when I cry out desperately for help,
>He has shut out my prayer.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>He has blocked every road I take with a wall of hewn stones;
>He has made every path impassable.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>To me he is like a bear lying in ambush,
>Like a hidden lion stalking its prey.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>He has obstructed my paths and torn me to pieces;
>He has made me desolate.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>He drew his bow and made me
>The target for his arrow.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>He shot his arrows
>Into my heart.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>I have become the laughingstock of all people,
>Their mocking song all day long.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>He has given me my fill of bitter herbs
>And made me drunk with bitterness.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>He ground my teeth in gravel;
>He trampled me in the dust.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>I am deprived of peace;
>I have forgotten what happiness is.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>So I said, “My endurance has expired;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have lost all hope of deliverance from the Lᴏʀᴅ.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 19
><span class=verse-first-poetry>19</span>Remember my impoverished and homeless condition,
>Which is a bitter poison.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>I continually think about this,
>And I am depressed.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>But this I call to mind;
>Therefore I have hope:
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ’s loyal kindness never ceases;
>His compassions never end.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span>They are fresh every morning;
>Your faithfulness is abundant!
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My portion is the Lᴏʀᴅ,” I have said to myself,
>So I will put my hope in him.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ is good to those who trust in him,
>To the one who seeks him.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span>It is good to wait patiently
>For deliverance from the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span>It is good for a man
>To bear the yoke while he is young.
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span>Let a person sit alone in silence,
>When the Lᴏʀᴅ is disciplining him.
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span>Let him bury his face in the dust;
>Perhaps there is hope.
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span>Let him offer his cheek to the one who hits him;
>Let him have his fill of insults.
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span>For the Lord will not
>Reject us forever.
###### 32
><span class=verse-body-poetry>32</span>Though he causes us grief, he then has compassion on us
>According to the abundance of his loyal kindness.
###### 33
><span class=verse-body-poetry>33</span>For he is not predisposed to afflict
>Or to grieve people.
###### 34
><span class=verse-body-poetry>34</span>To crush underfoot
>All the earth’s prisoners,
###### 35
><span class=verse-body-poetry>35</span>To deprive a person of his rights
>In the presence of the Most High,
###### 36
><span class=verse-body-poetry>36</span>To defraud a person in a lawsuit—
>The Lord does not approve of such things!
###### 37
><span class=verse-body-poetry>37</span>Whose command was ever fulfilled
>Unless the Lord decreed it?
###### 38
><span class=verse-body-poetry>38</span>Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that everything comes—
>Both calamity and blessing?
###### 39
><span class=verse-body-poetry>39</span>Why should any living person complain
>When punished for his sins?
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 40
><span class=verse-first-poetry>40</span>Let us carefully examine our ways,
>And let us return to the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 41
><span class=verse-body-poetry>41</span>Let us lift up our hearts and our hands
>To God in heaven:
###### 42
><span class=verse-body-poetry>42</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We have blatantly rebelled;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You have not forgiven.”
###### 43
><span class=verse-body-poetry>43</span>You shrouded yourself with anger and then pursued us;
>You killed without mercy.
###### 44
><span class=verse-body-poetry>44</span>You shrouded yourself with a cloud
>So that no prayer could get through.
###### 45
><span class=verse-body-poetry>45</span>You make us like filthy scum
>In the estimation of the nations.
###### 46
><span class=verse-body-poetry>46</span>All our enemies have gloated over us;
###### 47
><span class=verse-body-poetry>47</span>Panic and pitfall have come upon us,
>Devastation and destruction.
###### 48
><span class=verse-body-poetry>48</span>Streams of tears flow from my eyes
>Because my people are destroyed.
###### 49
><span class=verse-body-poetry>49</span>Tears flow from my eyes and will not stop;
>There will be no break
###### 50
><span class=verse-body-poetry>50</span>Until the Lᴏʀᴅ looks down from heaven
>And sees what has happened.
###### 51
><span class=verse-body-poetry>51</span>What my eyes see grieves me—
>All the suffering of the daughters in my city.
###### 52
><span class=verse-body-poetry>52</span>For no good reason my enemies
>Hunted me down like a bird.
###### 53
><span class=verse-body-poetry>53</span>They shut me up in a pit
>And threw stones at me.
###### 54
><span class=verse-body-poetry>54</span>The waters closed over my head;
>I thought I was about to die.
###### 55
><span class=verse-body-poetry>55</span>I have called on your name, O Lᴏʀᴅ,
>From the deepest pit.
###### 56
><span class=verse-body-poetry>56</span>You heard my plea:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not close your ears to my cry for relief!”
###### 57
><span class=verse-body-poetry>57</span>You came near on the day I called to you;
>You said, “Do not fear!”
###### 58
><span class=verse-body-poetry>58</span>O Lord, you championed my cause;
>You redeemed my life.
###### 59
><span class=verse-body-poetry>59</span>You have seen the wrong done to me, O Lᴏʀᴅ;
>Pronounce judgment on my behalf!
###### 60
><span class=verse-body-poetry>60</span>You have seen all their vengeance,
>All their plots against me.
###### 61
><span class=verse-body-poetry>61</span>You have heard their taunts, O Lᴏʀᴅ,
>All their plots against me.
###### 62
><span class=verse-body-poetry>62</span>My assailants revile and conspire
>Against me all day long.
###### 63
><span class=verse-body-poetry>63</span>Watch them from morning to evening;
>I am the object of their mocking songs.
###### 64
><span class=verse-body-poetry>64</span>Pay them back what they deserve, O Lᴏʀᴅ,
>According to what they have done.
###### 65
><span class=verse-body-poetry>65</span>Give them a distraught heart;
>May your curse be on them!
###### 66
><span class=verse-body-poetry>66</span>Pursue them in anger and eradicate them
>From under the Lᴏʀᴅ’s heaven.
