><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Those who trust in the Lᴏʀᴅ are like Mount Zion,
>Which cannot be moved and will endure forever.

><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>As the mountains surround Jerusalem,
>So the Lᴏʀᴅ surrounds his people,
>Now and forevermore.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Indeed, the scepter of a wicked king will not settle
>Upon the allotted land of the godly.
>Otherwise the godly
>Might do what is wrong.
