###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span> The people walking in darkness

###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>You have enlarged the nation;

###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>For their oppressive yoke
>And the club that strikes their shoulders,
>The cudgel the oppressor uses on them,
>You have shattered, as in the day of Midian’s defeat.
###### 5

><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span>The Lord decreed judgment on Jacob,
>And it fell on Israel.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>All the people were aware of it,

###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The bricks have fallen,

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The sycamore fig trees have been cut down,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But we will replace them with cedars.”
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Then the Lᴏʀᴅ provoked their adversaries to attack them,
>He stirred up their enemies—
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Syria from the east,
>And the Philistines from the west;

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span>The people did not return to the one who struck them,
>They did not seek reconciliation with the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>So the Lᴏʀᴅ cut off Israel’s head and tail,
>Both the shoots and stalk in one day.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>The leaders and the highly respected people are the head,
>The prophets who teach lies are the tail.

><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>The leaders of this nation were misleading people,
>And the people being led were destroyed.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>So the Lord was not pleased with their young men,
>He took no pity on their orphans and widows;
>For the whole nation was godless and did wicked things,
>Every mouth was speaking disgraceful words.
>Despite all this, his anger does not subside,
>And his hand is ready to strike again.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
><span class=verse-first-poetry>18</span>For evil burned like a fire,
>It consumed thorns and briers;
>It burned up the thickets of the forest,
>And they went up in smoke.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>Because of the anger of the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies, the land was scorched,

>And Ephraim against Manasseh;
>Together they fought against Judah.
>Despite all this, his anger does not subside,
>And his hand is ready to strike again.
