## A Parable of Two Eagles and a Vine
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Lord’s message came to me:
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“Son of man, offer a riddle, and tell a parable to the house of Israel.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“Say to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>‘A great eagle with broad wings, long feathers,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>With full plumage that was multi-hued,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Came to Lebanon and took the top of the cedar.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He plucked off its topmost shoot;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He brought it to a land of merchants
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And planted it in a city of traders.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He took one of the seedlings of the land,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Placed it in a cultivated plot;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>A shoot by abundant water,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Like a willow he planted it.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>It sprouted and became a vine,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Spreading low to the ground;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Its branches turning toward him, its roots were under itself.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>So it became a vine; it produced shoots and sent out branches.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>There was another great eagle
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>With broad wings and thick plumage.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Now this vine twisted its roots toward him
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And sent its branches toward him
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>To be watered from the soil where it was planted.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>In a good field, by abundant waters, it was planted
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>To grow branches, bear fruit, and become a beautiful vine.’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>“Say to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>‘Will it prosper?
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Will he not rip out its roots
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And cause its fruit to rot and wither?
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>All its foliage will wither.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>No strong arm or large army
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Will be needed to pull it out by its roots.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Consider! It is planted, but will it prosper?
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Will it not wither completely when the east wind blows on it?
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Will it not wither in the soil where it sprouted?’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>Then the Lord’s message came to me:
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>“Say to the rebellious house of Israel: ‘Don’t you know what these things mean?’ Say: ‘See here, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and took her king and her officials prisoner and brought them to himself in Babylon.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>“He took one from the royal family, made a treaty with him, and put him under oath. He then took the leaders of the land
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>“so it would be a lowly kingdom that could not rise on its own but had to keep its treaty with him in order to stand.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>“But this one from Israel’s royal family rebelled against the king of Babylon by sending his emissaries to Egypt to obtain horses and a large army. Will he prosper? Will the one doing these things escape? Can he break the covenant and escape?
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>“‘As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ, surely in the city of the king who crowned him, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke—in the middle of Babylon he will die!
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>‘Pharaoh with his great army and mighty horde will not help him in battle, when siege ramps are erected and siege walls are built to kill many people.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>‘He despised the oath by breaking the covenant. Take note—he gave his promise and did all these things. He will not escape!
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>“‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says: As surely as I live, I will certainly repay him for despising my oath and breaking my covenant!
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>‘I will throw my net over him and he will be caught in my snare; I will bring him to Babylon and judge him there because of the unfaithfulness he committed against me.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>‘All the choice men among his troops will die by the sword, and the survivors will be scattered to every wind. Then you will know that I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, have spoken!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 22
<span class=verse-first>22</span>“‘This is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>‘I will take a sprig from the lofty top of the cedar and plant it.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will pluck from the top one of its tender twigs;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I myself will plant it on a high and lofty mountain.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will plant it on a high mountain of Israel,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And it will raise branches and produce fruit and become a beautiful cedar.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Every bird will live under it;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Every winged creature will live in the shade of its branches.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>All the trees of the field will know that I am the Lᴏʀᴅ.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I make the high tree low; I raise up the low tree.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I make the green tree wither, and I make the dry tree sprout.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, have spoken, and I will do it!’”
