## Fertility Cult Festivals Have Intoxicated Israel
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>O Israel, do not rejoice jubilantly like the nations,
>For you are unfaithful to your God.
>You love to receive a prostitute’s wages
>On all the floors where you thresh your grain.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Threshing floors and wine vats will not feed the people,
>And new wine only deceives them.
## Assyrian Exile Will Reverse the Egyptian Exodus
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>They will not remain in the Lᴏʀᴅ’s land.
>Ephraim will return to Egypt;
>They will eat ritually unclean food in Assyria.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>They will not pour out drink offerings of wine to the Lᴏʀᴅ;
>They will not please him with their sacrifices.
>Their sacrifices will be like bread eaten while in mourning;
>All those who eat them will make themselves ritually unclean.
>For their bread will be only to satisfy their appetite;
>It will not come into the temple of the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>So what will you do on the festival day,
>On the festival days of the Lᴏʀᴅ?
## No Escape for the Israelites This Time
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Look! Even if they flee from the destruction,
>Egypt will take hold of them,
>And Memphis will bury them.
>The weeds will inherit the silver they treasure—
>Thorn bushes will occupy their homes.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span>The time of judgment is about to arrive!
>The time of retribution is imminent!
>Israel will be humbled!
## Israel Rejects Hosea’s Prophetic Exhortations
>The prophet is considered a fool—
>The inspired man is viewed as a madman—
>Because of the multitude of your sins
>And your intense animosity.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>The prophet is a watchman over Ephraim on behalf of God,
>Yet traps are laid for him along all his paths;
>Animosity rages against him in the land of his God.
## The Best of Times, the Worst of Times
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>They have sunk deep into corruption
>As in the days of Gibeah.
>He will remember their wrongdoing.
>He will repay them for their sins.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
><span class=verse-first-poetry>10</span>When I found Israel, it was like finding grapes in the wilderness.
>I viewed your ancestors like an early fig on a fig tree in its first season.
>Then they came to Baal Peor and they dedicated themselves to shame—
>They became as detestable as what they loved.
## The Fertility Worshipers Will Become Infertile
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Ephraim will be like a bird;
>What they value will fly away.
>They will not bear children—
>They will not enjoy pregnancy—
>They will not even conceive!
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Even if they raise their children,
>I will take away every last one of them.
>Woe to them!
>For I will turn away from them.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>Ephraim, as I have seen, has given their children for prey;
>Ephraim will bear his sons for slaughter.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>Give them, O Lᴏʀᴅ—
>What will you give them?
>Give them wombs that miscarry,
>And breasts that cannot nurse!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
><span class=verse-first-poetry>15</span>Because of all their evil in Gilgal,
>I hate them there.
>On account of their evil deeds,
>I will drive them out of my land.
>I will no longer love them;
>All their rulers are rebels.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>Ephraim will be struck down—
>Their root will be dried up;
>They will not yield any fruit.
>Even if they do bear children,
>I will kill their precious offspring.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>My God will reject them,
>For they have not obeyed him;
>So they will be fugitives among the nations.
