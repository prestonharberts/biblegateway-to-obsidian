###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Then Job answered:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even today my complaint is still bitter;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His hand is heavy despite my groaning.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>O that I knew where I might find him,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That I could come to his place of residence!
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I would lay out my case before him
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And fill my mouth with arguments.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I would know with what words he would answer me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And understand what he would say to me.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Would he contend with me with great power?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No, he would only pay attention to me.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There an upright person
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Could present his case before him,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I would be delivered forever from my judge.”
## The Inaccessibility and Power of God
###### 8
><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If I go to the east, he is not there,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And to the west, yet I do not perceive him.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In the north when he is at work,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I do not see him;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When he turns to the south,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I see no trace of him.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But he knows the pathway that I take;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If he tested me, I would come forth like gold.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My feet have followed his steps closely;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have kept to his way and have not turned aside.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have not departed from the commands of his lips;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my allotted portion.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But he is unchangeable, and who can change him?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Whatever he has desired, he does.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For he fulfills his decree against me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And many such things are his plans.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That is why I am terrified in his presence;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When I consider, I am afraid because of him.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, God has made my heart faint;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Almighty has terrified me.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yet I have not been silent because of the darkness,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because of the thick darkness
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That covered my face.
