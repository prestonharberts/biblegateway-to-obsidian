## The Lord Appeals to the Exiles
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Listen to this, O family of Jacob,
>You who are called by the name ‘Israel,’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And are descended from Judah,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who take oaths in the name of the Lᴏʀᴅ,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And invoke the God of Israel—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But not in an honest and just manner.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, they live in the holy city;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They trust in the God of Israel,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Whose name is the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I announced events beforehand,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I issued the decrees and made the predictions;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Suddenly I acted and they came to pass.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I did this because I know how stubborn you are.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your neck muscles are like iron
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And your forehead like bronze.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I announced them to you beforehand;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Before they happened, I predicted them for you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So you could never say,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>My image did these things,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>My idol, my cast image, decreed them.’
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You have heard; now look at all the evidence!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will you not admit that what I say is true?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>From this point on I am announcing to you new events
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That are previously unrevealed and you do not know about.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Now they come into being, not in the past;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Before today you did not hear about them,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So you could not say,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Yes, I know about them.’
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You did not hear,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You do not know,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You were not told beforehand.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I know that you are very deceitful;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You were labeled a rebel from birth.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the sake of my reputation I hold back my anger;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the sake of my prestige I restrain myself from destroying you.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, I have refined you, but not as silver;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have purified you in the furnace of misery.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For my sake alone I will act,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For how can I allow my name to be defiled?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will not share my glory with anyone else!

###### 12
><span class=verse-first-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Listen to me, O Jacob,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Israel, whom I summoned.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I am the one;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I am present at the very beginning
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And at the very end.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yes, my hand founded the earth;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My right hand spread out the sky.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I summon them;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They stand together.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All of you, gather together and listen!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who among them announced these things?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ’s ally will carry out his desire against Babylon;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will exert his power against the Babylonians.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I, I have spoken—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yes, I have summoned him;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I lead him and he will succeed.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Approach me—listen to this!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>From the very first I have not spoken in secret;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When it happens, I am there.”
>So now, the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ has sent me, accompanied by his Spirit.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
><span class=verse-first-poetry>17</span>This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ, your Protector, says,
>The Holy One of Israel:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I am the Lᴏʀᴅ your God,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who teaches you how to succeed,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who leads you in the way you should go.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If only you had obeyed my commandments,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Prosperity would have flowed to you like a river,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Deliverance would have come to you like the waves of the sea.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your descendants would have been as numerous as sand,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And your children like its granules.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their name would not have been cut off
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And eliminated from my presence.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 20
><span class=verse-first-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Leave Babylon!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Flee from the Babylonians!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Announce it with a shout of joy!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Make this known—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Proclaim it throughout the earth!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Say, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ protects his servant Jacob.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They do not thirst as he leads them through dry regions;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He makes water flow out of a rock for them;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He splits open a rock and water flows out.’
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There will be no prosperity for the wicked,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
