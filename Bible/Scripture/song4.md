## The Wedding Night: Praise of the Bride
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Oh, you are beautiful, my darling!
>Oh, you are beautiful!
>Your eyes behind your veil are like doves.
>Your hair is like a flock of female goats
>Descending from Mount Gilead.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Your teeth are like a flock of newly shorn sheep
>Coming up from the washing place;
>Each of them has a twin,
>And not one of them is missing.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Your lips are like a scarlet thread;
>Your mouth is lovely.
>Your forehead behind your veil
>Is like a slice of pomegranate.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>Your neck is like the tower of David
>Built with courses of stones;
>One thousand shields are hung on it—
>All shields of valiant warriors.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Your two breasts are like two fawns,
>Twins of the gazelle
>Grazing among the lilies.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Until the dawn arrives
>And the shadows flee,
>I will go up to the mountain of myrrh,
>And to the hill of frankincense.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span>You are altogether beautiful, my darling!
>There is no blemish in you!
## The Wedding Night: Beautiful as Lebanon
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,
>Come with me from Lebanon.
>Descend from the crest of Amana,
>From the top of Senir, the summit of Hermon,
>From the lions’ dens
>And the mountain haunts of the leopards.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>You have stolen my heart, my sister, my bride!
>You have stolen my heart with one glance of your eyes,
>With one jewel of your necklace.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>How delightful is your love, my sister, my bride!
>How much better is your love than wine;
>The fragrance of your perfume is better than any spice!
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Your lips drip sweetness like the honeycomb, my bride,
>Honey and milk are under your tongue.
>The fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon.
## The Wedding Night: The Delightful Garden
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>You are a locked garden, my sister, my bride;
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

you are an enclosed spring, a sealed-up fountain.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>Your shoots are a royal garden full of pomegranates
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

with choice fruits:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

henna with nard,
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>nard and saffron,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

calamus and cinnamon with every kind of spice,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

myrrh and aloes with all the finest spices.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>You are a garden spring,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

a well of fresh water flowing down from Lebanon.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 16
><span class=verse-first-poetry>16</span>Awake, O north wind; come, O south wind!
>Blow on my garden so that its fragrant spices may send out their sweet smell.
>May my beloved come into his garden
>And eat its delightful fruit!
