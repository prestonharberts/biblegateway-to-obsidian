## Confrontation and Repentance at Bokim
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The angel of the Lᴏʀᴅ went up from Gilgal to Bokim. He said, “I brought you up from Egypt and led you into the land I had solemnly promised to give to your ancestors. I said, ‘I will never break my covenant with you,
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>‘but you must not make an agreement with the people who live in this land. You should tear down the altars where they worship.’ But you have disobeyed me. Why would you do such a thing?
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“At that time I also warned you, ‘If you disobey, I will not drive out the Canaanites before you. They will ensnare you and their gods will lure you away.’”
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>When the angel of the Lᴏʀᴅ finished speaking these words to all the Israelites, the people wept loudly.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>They named that place Bokim and offered sacrifices to the Lᴏʀᴅ there.
## The End of an Era
###### 6
<span class=verse-first>6</span>When Joshua dismissed the people, the Israelites went to their allotted portions of territory, intending to take possession of the land.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>The people worshiped the Lᴏʀᴅ throughout Joshua’s lifetime and as long as the elderly men who outlived him remained alive. These men had witnessed all the great things the Lᴏʀᴅ had done for Israel.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>Joshua son of Nun, the Lᴏʀᴅ’s servant, died at the age of 110.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>The people buried him in his allotted land in Timnath Heres in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>That entire generation passed away; a new generation grew up that had not personally experienced the Lᴏʀᴅ’s presence or seen what he had done for Israel.
## A Monotonous Cycle
###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>The Israelites did evil before the Lᴏʀᴅ by worshiping the Baals.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>They abandoned the Lᴏʀᴅ God of their ancestors who brought them out of the land of Egypt. They followed other gods—the gods of the nations who lived around them. They worshiped them and made the Lᴏʀᴅ angry.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>They abandoned the Lᴏʀᴅ and worshiped Baal and the Ashtoreths.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ was furious with Israel and handed them over to robbers who plundered them. He turned them over to their enemies who lived around them. They could no longer withstand their enemies’ attacks.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>Whenever they went out to fight, the Lᴏʀᴅ did them harm, just as he had warned and solemnly vowed he would do. They suffered greatly.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 16
<span class=verse-first>16</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ raised up leaders who delivered them from these robbers.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>But they did not obey their leaders. Instead they prostituted themselves to other gods and worshiped them. They quickly turned aside from the path their ancestors had walked. Their ancestors had obeyed the Lᴏʀᴅ’s commands, but they did not.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>When the Lᴏʀᴅ raised up leaders for them, the Lᴏʀᴅ was with each leader and delivered the people from their enemies while the leader remained alive. The Lᴏʀᴅ felt sorry for them when they cried out in agony because of what their harsh oppressors did to them.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>When a leader died, the next generation would again act more wickedly than the previous one. They would follow after other gods, worshiping them and bowing down to them. They did not give up their practices or their stubborn ways.
## A Divine Decision
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ was furious with Israel. He said, “This nation has violated the terms of the covenant I made with their ancestors by disobeying me.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>“So I will no longer remove before them any of the nations that Joshua left unconquered when he died,
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>“in order to test Israel. I want to see whether or not the people will carefully walk in the path marked out by the Lᴏʀᴅ, as their ancestors were careful to do.”
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>This is why the Lᴏʀᴅ permitted these nations to remain and did not conquer them immediately; he did not hand them over to Joshua.
