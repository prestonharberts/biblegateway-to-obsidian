<span class=verse-body>23</span>“Tell the Israelites, ‘You must not eat any fat of an ox, sheep, or goat.
###### 24

###### 28
<span class=verse-first>28</span>Then the Lᴏʀᴅ spoke to Moses:
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>“Tell the Israelites, ‘The one who presents his peace-offering sacrifice to the Lᴏʀᴅ must bring part of his offering to the Lᴏʀᴅ as his sacrifice.
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>‘With his own hands he must bring the Lᴏʀᴅ’s gifts. He must bring the fat with the breast to wave the breast as a wave offering before the Lᴏʀᴅ,
###### 31
<span class=verse-body>31</span>‘and the priest must offer the fat up in smoke on the altar, but the breast will belong to Aaron and his sons.
###### 32
<span class=verse-body>32</span>‘The right thigh you must give as a contribution offering to the priest from your peace-offering sacrifice.
###### 33
<span class=verse-body>33</span>‘The one from Aaron’s sons who presents the blood of the peace offering and fat will have the right thigh as his share,
###### 34
<span class=verse-body>34</span>‘for the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution offering I have taken from the Israelites out of their peace-offering sacrifices and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons from the people of Israel as a perpetual allotted portion.’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 35
<span class=verse-first>35</span>This is the allotment of Aaron and the allotment of his sons from the Lᴏʀᴅ’s gifts on the day Moses presented them to serve as priests to the Lᴏʀᴅ.
