## Babylon is Destroyed
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>After these things I saw another angel, who possessed great authority, coming down out of heaven, and the earth was lit up by his radiance.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>He shouted with a powerful voice:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Fallen, fallen, is Babylon the great!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>She has become a lair for demons,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A haunt for every unclean spirit,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A haunt for every unclean bird,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A haunt for every unclean and detested beast.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For all the nations have fallen from
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The wine of her immoral passion,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality with her,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the merchants of the earth have gotten rich from the power of her sensual behavior.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 4
<span class=verse-first>4</span>Then I heard another voice from heaven saying, “Come out of her, my people, so you will not take part in her sins and so you will not receive her plagues,
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“because her sins have piled up all the way to heaven and God has remembered her crimes.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>“Repay her the same way she repaid others; pay her back double corresponding to her deeds. In the cup she mixed, mix double the amount for her.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“As much as she exalted herself and lived in sensual luxury, to this extent give her torment and grief because she said to herself, ‘I rule as queen and am no widow; I will never experience grief!’
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>“For this reason, she will experience her plagues in a single day: disease, mourning, and famine, and she will be burned down with fire, because the Lord God who judges her is powerful!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
<span class=verse-first>9</span>Then the kings of the earth who committed immoral acts with her and lived in sensual luxury with her will weep and wail for her when they see the smoke from the fire that burns her up.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>They will stand a long way off because they are afraid of her torment, and will say,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Woe, woe, O great city,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Babylon the powerful city!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For in a single hour your doom has come!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>Then the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn for her because no one buys their cargo any longer—
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>cargo such as gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine linen, purple cloth, silk, scarlet cloth, all sorts of things made of citron wood, all sorts of objects made of ivory, all sorts of things made of expensive wood, bronze, iron and marble,
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>cinnamon, spice, incense, perfumed ointment, frankincense, wine, olive oil and costly flour, wheat, cattle and sheep, horses and four-wheeled carriages, slaves and human lives.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>The ripe fruit you greatly desired
>Has gone from you,
>And all your luxury and splendor
>Have gone from you—
>They will never ever be found again!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>The merchants who sold these things, who got rich from her, will stand a long way off because they are afraid of her torment. They will weep and mourn,
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>saying,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Woe, woe, O great city—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Dressed in fine linen, purple and scarlet clothing,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls—
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because in a single hour such great wealth has been destroyed!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

And every ship’s captain, and all who sail along the coast—seamen, and all who make their living from the sea, stood a long way off
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>and began to shout when they saw the smoke from the fire that burned her up, “Who is like the great city?”
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>And they threw dust on their heads and were shouting with weeping and mourning,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Woe, Woe, O great city—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In which all those who had ships on the sea got rich from her wealth—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because in a single hour she has been destroyed!”
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>Rejoice over her, O heaven,
>And you saints and apostles and prophets,
>For God has pronounced judgment against her on your behalf!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 21
<span class=verse-first>21</span>Then one powerful angel picked up a stone like a huge millstone, threw it into the sea, and said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>With this kind of sudden violent force
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Babylon the great city will be thrown down
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And it will never be found again!
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the sound of the harpists, musicians,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Flute players, and trumpeters
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will never be heard in you again.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No craftsman who practices any trade
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will ever be found in you again;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The noise of a mill will never be heard in you again.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even the light from a lamp
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will never shine in you again!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The voices of the bridegroom and his bride
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will never be heard in you again.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For your merchants were the tycoons of the world,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because all the nations were deceived by your magic spells!
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The blood of the saints and prophets was found in her,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Along with the blood of all those who had been killed on the earth.”
