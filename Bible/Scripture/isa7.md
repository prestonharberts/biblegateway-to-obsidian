## Ahaz Receives a Sign
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>During the reign of Ahaz son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, King Rezin of Syria and King Pekah son of Remaliah of Israel marched up to Jerusalem to do battle, but they were unable to prevail against it.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>It was reported to the family of David, “Syria has allied with Ephraim.” They and their people were emotionally shaken, just as the trees of the forest shake before the wind.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 3
<span class=verse-first>3</span>So the Lᴏʀᴅ told Isaiah, “Go out with your son Shear Jashub and meet Ahaz at the end of the conduit of the upper pool that is located on the road to the field where they wash and dry cloth.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“Tell him, ‘Make sure you stay calm! Don’t be afraid. Don’t be intimidated by these two stubs of smoking logs, or by the raging anger of Rezin, Syria, and the son of Remaliah.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“Syria has plotted with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah to bring about your demise.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>“They say, “Let’s attack Judah, terrorize it, and conquer it. Then we’ll set up the son of Tabeel as its king.”
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>For this reason the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>‘It will not take place;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>It will not happen.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For Syria’s leader is Damascus,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And the leader of Damascus is Rezin.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Within sixty-five years Ephraim will no longer exist as a nation.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Ephraim’s leader is Samaria,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And Samaria’s leader is the son of Remaliah.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>If your faith does not remain firm,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Then you will not remain secure.’”

###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ again spoke to Ahaz:
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>“Ask for a confirming sign from the Lᴏʀᴅ your God. You can even ask for something miraculous.”
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>But Ahaz responded, “I don’t want to ask; I don’t want to put the Lᴏʀᴅ to a test.”
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>So Isaiah replied, “Pay attention, family of David. Do you consider it too insignificant to try the patience of men? Is that why you are also trying the patience of my God?
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>“For this reason the Lord himself will give you a confirming sign. Look, this young woman is about to conceive and will give birth to a son. You, young woman, will name him Immanuel.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>“He will eat sour milk and honey, which will help him know how to reject evil and choose what is right.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>“Here is why this will be so: Before the child knows how to reject evil and choose what is right, the land whose two kings you fear will be desolate.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>“The Lᴏʀᴅ will bring on you, your people, and your father’s family a time unlike any since Ephraim departed from Judah—the king of Assyria!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span>At that time the Lᴏʀᴅ will whistle for flies from the distant streams of Egypt and for bees from the land of Assyria.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>All of them will come and make their home in the ravines between the cliffs and in the crevices of the cliffs, in all the thorn bushes, and in all the watering holes.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 20
<span class=verse-first>20</span>At that time the Lord will use a razor hired from the banks of the Euphrates River, the king of Assyria, to shave the hair off the head and private parts; it will also shave off the beard.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 21
<span class=verse-first>21</span>At that time a man will keep alive a young cow from the herd and a couple of goats.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>From the abundance of milk they produce, he will have sour milk for his meals. Indeed, everyone left in the heart of the land will eat sour milk and honey.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 23
<span class=verse-first>23</span>At that time every place where there had been 1,000 vines worth 1,000 silver shekels will be overrun with thorns and briers.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>With bow and arrow people will hunt there, for the whole land will be covered with thorns and briers.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>They will stay away from all the hills that were cultivated for fear of the thorns and briers. Cattle will graze there, and sheep will trample on them.
