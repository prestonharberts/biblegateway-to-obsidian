## Eliphaz Begins to Speak
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If someone should attempt a word with you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will you be impatient?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But who can refrain from speaking?
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, you have instructed many;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You have strengthened feeble hands.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your words have supported those
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who stumbled,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And you have strengthened the knees
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That gave way.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But now the same thing comes to you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And you are discouraged;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It strikes you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And you are terrified.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is not your piety your confidence,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And your blameless ways your hope?
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Call to mind now:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who, being innocent, ever perished?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And where were upright people ever destroyed?
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even as I have seen, those who plow iniquity
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And those who sow trouble reap the same.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>By the breath of God they perish,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And by the blast of his anger they are consumed.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There is the roaring of the lion
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the growling of the young lion,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But the teeth of the young lions are broken.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The mighty lion perishes for lack of prey,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the cubs of the lioness are scattered.”
## Ungodly Complainers Provoke God’s Wrath
###### 12
><span class=verse-first-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Now a word was stealthily brought to me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And my ear caught a whisper of it.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In the troubling thoughts of the dreams in the night
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When a deep sleep falls on men,
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Dread gripped me and trembling,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Which made all my bones shake.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then a breath of air passes by my face;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It makes the hair of my flesh stand up.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It stands still,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But I cannot recognize its appearance;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>An image is before my eyes,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I hear a murmuring voice:
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Is a mortal man righteous before God?
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Or a man pure before his Creator?
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>If God puts no trust in his servants
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And attributes folly to his angels,
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>How much more to those who live in houses of clay,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Whose foundation is in the dust,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Who are crushed like a moth?
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They are destroyed between morning and evening;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They perish forever without anyone regarding it.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Is not their excess wealth taken away from them?
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They die, yet without attaining wisdom.’”
