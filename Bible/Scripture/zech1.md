## Introduction
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>In the eighth month of Darius’ second year, the Lᴏʀᴅ’s message came to the prophet Zechariah, son of Berechiah son of Iddo:
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“The Lᴏʀᴅ was very angry with your ancestors.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“Therefore say to the people: The Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies says, ‘Turn to me,’ says the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies, ‘and I will turn to you,’ says the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“Do not be like your ancestors, to whom the former prophets called out, saying, ‘This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies has said, “Turn now from your evil wickedness.”’ But they would by no means obey me, says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“As for your ancestors, where are they? And did the prophets live forever?
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>“But have my words and statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, not outlived your fathers? Then they paid attention and confessed, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies has indeed done what he said he would do to us, because of our sinful ways.’”
## The Introduction to the Visions
###### 7
<span class=verse-first>7</span>On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the month Shebat, in Darius’ second year, the Lᴏʀᴅ’s message came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berechiah son of Iddo:
## The Content of the First Vision
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>I was attentive that night and saw a man seated on a red horse that stood among some myrtle trees in the ravine. Behind him were red, sorrel, and white horses.
## The Interpretation of the First Vision
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>Then I asked one nearby, “What are these, sir?” The angelic messenger who replied to me said, “I will show you what these are.”
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>Then the man standing among the myrtle trees spoke up and said, “These are the ones whom the Lᴏʀᴅ has sent to walk about on the earth.”
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>The riders then agreed with the angel of the Lᴏʀᴅ, who was standing among the myrtle trees, “We have been walking about on the earth, and now everything is at rest and quiet.”

###### 12
<span class=verse-first>12</span>The angel of the Lᴏʀᴅ then asked, “O Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies, how long before you have compassion on Jerusalem and the other cities of Judah that you have been so angry with for these seventy years?”
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ then addressed good, comforting words to the angelic messenger who was speaking to me.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>Turning to me, the messenger then said, “Cry out that the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies says, ‘I am very much moved for Jerusalem and for Zion.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>‘But I am greatly displeased with the nations that take my grace for granted. I was a little displeased with them, but they have only made things worse for themselves.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

‘## The Oracle of Response
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>“‘Therefore,’ this is what the Lᴏʀᴅ has said, ‘I have become compassionate toward Jerusalem and will rebuild my temple in it,’ says the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies. ‘Once more a surveyor’s measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem.’
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>“Speak up again with the message of the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies: ‘My cities will once more overflow with prosperity, and once more the Lᴏʀᴅ will comfort Zion and validate his choice of Jerusalem.’”
## Vision Two: The Four Horns
###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span> Once again I looked and this time I saw four horns.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>So I asked the angelic messenger who spoke with me, “What are these?” He replied, “These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>Next the Lᴏʀᴅ showed me four blacksmiths.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>I asked, “What are these going to do?” He answered, “These horns are the ones that have scattered Judah so that there is no one to be seen. But the blacksmiths have come to terrify Judah’s enemies and cut off the horns of the nations that have thrust themselves against the land of Judah in order to scatter its people.”
