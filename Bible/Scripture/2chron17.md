## Jehoshaphat Becomes King
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>His son Jehoshaphat replaced him as king and solidified his rule over Israel.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>He placed troops in all Judah’s fortified cities and posted garrisons throughout the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that his father Asa had seized.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ was with Jehoshaphat because he followed in his ancestor David’s footsteps at the beginning of his reign. He did not seek the Baals,
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>but instead sought the God of his ancestors and obeyed his commands, unlike the Israelites.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ made his kingdom secure; all Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he became very wealthy and greatly respected.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>He was committed to following the Lᴏʀᴅ; he even removed the high places and Asherah poles from Judah.
