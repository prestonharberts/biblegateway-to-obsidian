###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Praise the Lᴏʀᴅ.
>Give thanks to the Lᴏʀᴅ, for he is good,
>And his loyal love endures.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Who can adequately recount the Lᴏʀᴅ’s mighty acts,
>Or relate all his praiseworthy deeds?
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>How blessed are those who promote justice,
>And do what is right all the time.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span>Remember me, O Lᴏʀᴅ, when you show favor to your people.
>Pay attention to me, when you deliver,
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>So I may see the prosperity of your chosen ones,
>Rejoice along with your nation,
>And boast along with the people who belong to you.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 6
><span class=verse-first-poetry>6</span>We have sinned like our ancestors;
>We have done wrong, we have done evil.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Our ancestors in Egypt failed to appreciate your miraculous deeds.
>They failed to remember your many acts of loyal love,
>And they rebelled at the sea, by the Red Sea.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Yet he delivered them for the sake of his reputation,
>That he might reveal his power.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>He shouted at the Red Sea and it dried up;
>He led them through the deep water as if it were a desert.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>He delivered them from the power of the one who hated them,
>And rescued them from the power of the enemy.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>The water covered their enemies;
>Not even one of them survived.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>They believed his promises;
>They sang praises to him.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span>They quickly forgot what he had done;
>They did not wait for his instructions.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>In the wilderness they had an insatiable craving for meat;
>They challenged God in the wastelands.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>He granted their request,
>Then struck them with a disease.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 16
><span class=verse-first-poetry>16</span>In the camp they resented Moses,
>And Aaron, the Lᴏʀᴅ’s holy priest.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan;
>It engulfed the group led by Abiram.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>Fire burned their group;
>The flames scorched the wicked.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 19
><span class=verse-first-poetry>19</span>They made an image of a calf at Horeb,
>And worshiped a metal idol.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>They traded their majestic God
>For the image of an ox that eats grass.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>They rejected the God who delivered them,
>The one who performed great deeds in Egypt,
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>Amazing feats in the land of Ham,
>Mighty acts by the Red Sea.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span>He threatened to destroy them,
>But Moses, his chosen one, interceded with him
>And turned back his destructive anger.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span>They rejected the fruitful land;
>They did not believe his promise.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span>They grumbled in their tents;
>They did not obey the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span>So he made a solemn vow
>That he would make them die in the wilderness,
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span>Make their descendants die among the nations,
>And scatter them among foreign lands.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 28
><span class=verse-first-poetry>28</span>They worshiped Baal of Peor,
>And ate sacrifices offered to the dead.
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span>They made the Lᴏʀᴅ angry by their actions,
>And a plague broke out among them.
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span>Phinehas took a stand and intervened,
>And the plague subsided.
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span>This was credited to Phinehas as a righteous act
>For all generations to come.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 32
><span class=verse-first-poetry>32</span>They made him angry by the waters of Meribah,
>And Moses suffered because of them,
###### 33
><span class=verse-body-poetry>33</span>For they aroused his temper,
>And he spoke rashly.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 34
><span class=verse-first-poetry>34</span>They did not destroy the nations,
>As the Lᴏʀᴅ had commanded them to do.
###### 35
><span class=verse-body-poetry>35</span>They mixed in with the nations
>And learned their ways.
###### 36
><span class=verse-body-poetry>36</span>They worshiped their idols,
>Which became a snare to them.
###### 37
><span class=verse-body-poetry>37</span>They sacrificed their sons and daughters to demons.
###### 38
><span class=verse-body-poetry>38</span>They shed innocent blood—
>The blood of their sons and daughters,
>Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan.
>The land was polluted by bloodshed.
###### 39
><span class=verse-body-poetry>39</span>They were defiled by their deeds,
>And unfaithful in their actions.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 40
><span class=verse-first-poetry>40</span>So the Lᴏʀᴅ was angry with his people
>And despised the people who belonged to him.
###### 41
><span class=verse-body-poetry>41</span>He handed them over to the nations,
>And those who hated them ruled over them.
###### 42
><span class=verse-body-poetry>42</span>Their enemies oppressed them;
>They were subject to their authority.
###### 43
><span class=verse-body-poetry>43</span>Many times he delivered them,
>But they had a rebellious attitude,
>And degraded themselves by their sin.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 44
><span class=verse-first-poetry>44</span>Yet he took notice of their distress,
>When he heard their cry for help.
###### 45
><span class=verse-body-poetry>45</span>He remembered his covenant with them,
>And relented because of his great loyal love.
###### 46
><span class=verse-body-poetry>46</span>He caused all their conquerors
>To have pity on them.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 47
><span class=verse-first-poetry>47</span>Deliver us, O Lᴏʀᴅ, our God.
>Gather us from among the nations.
>Then we will give thanks to your holy name,
>And boast about your praiseworthy deeds.
###### 48
><span class=verse-body-poetry>48</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ God of Israel deserves praise,
>In the future and forevermore.
>Let all the people say, “We agree! Praise the Lᴏʀᴅ!”
