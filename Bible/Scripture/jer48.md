## Judgment Against Moab
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, spoke about Moab:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Sure to be judged is Nebo! Indeed, it will be destroyed.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Kiriathaim will suffer disgrace. It will be captured!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Its fortress will suffer disgrace. It will be torn down!
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>People will not praise Moab anymore.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The enemy will capture Heshbon and plot how to destroy Moab,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Saying, ‘Come, let’s put an end to that nation!’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>City of Madmen, you will also be destroyed.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A destructive army will march against you.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Cries of anguish will arise in Horonaim,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Oh, the ruin and great destruction!’
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Moab will be crushed.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Her children will cry out in distress.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed they will climb the slopes of Luhith,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Weeping continually as they go.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For on the road down to Horonaim
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will hear the cries of distress over the destruction.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will hear, ‘Run! Save yourselves;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Even if you must be like a lonely shrub in the wilderness!’
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Moab, you trust in the things you do and in your riches.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So you too will be conquered.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your god Chemosh will go into exile
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Along with his priests and his officials.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The destroyer will come against every town.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Not one town will escape.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The towns in the valley will be destroyed.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The cities on the high plain will be laid waste.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, have spoken.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Set up a gravestone for Moab,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For it will certainly be laid in ruins!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Its cities will be laid waste
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And become uninhabited.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A curse on anyone who is lax in doing the Lᴏʀᴅ’s work!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A curse on anyone who keeps from carrying out his destruction!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
><span class=verse-first-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>From its earliest days Moab has lived undisturbed.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It has never been taken into exile.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Its people are like wine allowed to settle undisturbed on its dregs,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Never poured out from one jar to another.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are like wine that tastes like it always did,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Whose aroma has remained unchanged.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But the time is coming when I will send
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Men against Moab who will empty it out.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will empty the towns of their people,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then will lay those towns in ruins.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm it!
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The people of Moab will be disappointed by their god Chemosh.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will be as disappointed as the people of Israel were
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When they put their trust in the calf god at Bethel.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How can you men of Moab say, ‘We are heroes,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Men who are mighty in battle?’
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Moab will be destroyed. Its towns will be invaded.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Its finest young men will be slaughtered.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I, the King, the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies, affirm it!
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Moab’s destruction is at hand.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Disaster will come on it quickly.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Mourn for that nation, all you nations living around it,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All you nations that know of its fame.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Mourn and say, ‘Alas, its powerful influence has been broken!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Its glory and power have been done away with!’
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Come down from your place of honor;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Sit on the dry ground, you who live in Dibon.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the one who will destroy Moab will attack you;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will destroy your fortifications.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You who live in Aroer,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Stand by the road and watch.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Question the man who is fleeing and the woman who is escaping.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Ask them, ‘What has happened?’
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will answer, ‘Moab is disgraced, for it has fallen!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Wail and cry out in mourning!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Announce along the Arnon River
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>That Moab has been destroyed.’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 21
<span class=verse-first>21</span>“Judgment will come on the cities on the high plain: on Holon, Jahzah, and Mephaath;
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>“on Dibon, Nebo, and Beth Diblathaim;
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>“on Kiriathaim, Beth Gamul, and Beth Meon;
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>“on Kerioth and Bozrah. It will come on all the towns of Moab, both far and near.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>“Moab’s might will be crushed. Its power will be broken. I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm it!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Moab has vaunted itself against me.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So make him drunk with the wine of my wrath
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Until he splashes around in his own vomit,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Until others treat him as a laughingstock.
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For did not you people of Moab laugh at the people of Israel?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Did you think that they were nothing but thieves,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That you shook your head in contempt
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Every time you talked about them?
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Leave your towns, you inhabitants of Moab.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Go and live in the cliffs.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Be like a dove that makes its nest
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>High on the sides of a ravine.
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have heard how proud the people of Moab are,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I know how haughty they are.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have heard how arrogant, proud, and haughty they are,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>What a high opinion they have of themselves.
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm that I know how arrogant they are.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But their pride is ill founded.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their boastings will prove to be false.
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So I will weep with sorrow for Moab.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will cry out in sadness for all Moab.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will moan for the people of Kir Heres.
###### 32
><span class=verse-body-poetry>32</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will weep for the grapevines of Sibmah
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Just like the town of Jazer weeps over them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their branches once spread as far as the Dead Sea.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They reached as far as the town of Jazer.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The destroyer will ravage
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Her fig, date, and grape crops.
###### 33
><span class=verse-body-poetry>33</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Joy and gladness will disappear
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>From the fruitful land of Moab.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will stop the flow of wine from the winepresses.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No one will stomp on the grapes there and shout for joy.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The shouts there will be shouts of soldiers,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Not the shouts of those making wine.
###### 34
><span class=verse-body-poetry>34</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Cries of anguish raised from Heshbon and Elealeh
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will be sounded as far as Jahaz.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will be sounded from Zoar as far as Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For even the waters of Nimrim will be dried up.
###### 35
><span class=verse-body-poetry>35</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will put an end in Moab
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To those who make offerings at her places of worship.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will put an end to those who sacrifice to other gods.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm it!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 36
><span class=verse-first-poetry>36</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So my heart moans for Moab
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a flute playing a funeral song.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yes, like a flute playing a funeral song,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My heart moans for the people of Kir Heres.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the wealth they have gained will perish.
###### 37
><span class=verse-body-poetry>37</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For all of them will shave their heads in mourning.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will all cut off their beards to show their sorrow.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will all make gashes in their hands.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will all put on sackcloth.
###### 38
><span class=verse-body-poetry>38</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>On all the housetops in Moab
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And in all its public squares
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There will be nothing but mourning.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I will break Moab like an unwanted jar.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm it!
###### 39
><span class=verse-body-poetry>39</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Oh, how shattered Moab will be!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Oh, how her people will wail!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Oh, how she will turn away in shame!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Moab will become an object of ridicule,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A terrifying sight to all the nations that surround her.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 40
><span class=verse-first-poetry>40</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ says,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look! Like an eagle with outspread wings
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A nation will swoop down on Moab.
###### 41
><span class=verse-body-poetry>41</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Her towns will be captured;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Her fortresses will be taken.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>At that time the soldiers of Moab will be frightened
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a woman in labor.
###### 42
><span class=verse-body-poetry>42</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Moab will be destroyed and no longer be a nation,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because she has vaunted herself against the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 43
><span class=verse-body-poetry>43</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Terror, pits, and traps are in store
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the people who live in Moab.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm it!
###### 44
><span class=verse-body-poetry>44</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Anyone who flees at the sound of terror
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will fall into a pit.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Anyone who climbs out of the pit
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will be caught in a trap.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the time is coming
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When I will punish the people of Moab.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm it!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 45
><span class=verse-first-poetry>45</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In the shadows of the walls of Heshbon
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those trying to escape will stand helpless.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For a fire will burst forth from Heshbon.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Flames will shoot out from the former territory of Sihon.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will burn the foreheads of the people of Moab,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The skulls of those war-loving people.
###### 46
><span class=verse-body-poetry>46</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Moab, you are doomed!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You people who worship Chemosh will be destroyed.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your sons will be taken away captive.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your daughters will be carried away into exile.
###### 47
><span class=verse-body-poetry>47</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yet in future days
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will reverse Moab’s ill fortune,”
>Says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

The judgment against Moab ends here.
