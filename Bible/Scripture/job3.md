## II. Job’s Dialogue With His Friends [3:
## 1-27:
## 23]
## Job Regrets His Birth
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day he was born.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>Job spoke up and said:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let the day on which I was born perish,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the night that said,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>A man has been conceived!’
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That day—let it be darkness;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let not God on high regard it,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Nor let light shine on it!
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let darkness and the deepest shadow claim it;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let a cloud settle on it;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let whatever blackens the day terrify it.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That night—let darkness seize it;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let it not be included among the days of the year;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let it not enter among the number of the months!
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, let that night be barren;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let no shout of joy penetrate it!
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let those who curse the day curse it—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those who are prepared to rouse Leviathan.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let its morning stars be darkened;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let it wait for daylight but find none,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Nor let it see the first rays of dawn,
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because it did not shut the doors of my mother’s womb on me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.”
## Job Wishes He Had Died at Birth
###### 11
><span class=verse-first-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why did I not die at birth,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And why did I not expire
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As I came out of the womb?
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why did the knees welcome me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And why were there two breasts
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That I might nurse at them?
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For now I would be lying down
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And would be quiet,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I would be asleep and then at peace
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>With kings and counselors of the earth
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who built for themselves places now desolate,
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or with princes who possessed gold,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who filled their palaces with silver.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or why was I not buried
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a stillborn infant,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like infants who have never seen the light?
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There the wicked cease from turmoil,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And there the weary are at rest.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There the prisoners relax together;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They do not hear the voice of the oppressor.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Small and great are there,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the slave is free from his master.”
## Longing for Death
###### 20
><span class=verse-first-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why does God give light to one who is in misery,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And life to those whose soul is bitter,
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To those who wait for death that does not come,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And search for it
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>More than for hidden treasures,
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who rejoice even to jubilation,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And are exultant when they find the grave?
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why is light given to a man
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Whose way is hidden,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And whom God has hedged in?
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For my sighing comes in place of my food,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And my groanings flow forth like water.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the very thing I dreaded has happened to me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And what I feared has come upon me.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have no ease, I have no quietness;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I cannot rest; turmoil has come upon me.”
