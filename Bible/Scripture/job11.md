###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Should not this abundance of words be answered,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or should this talkative man
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Be vindicated?
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Should people remain silent at your idle talk,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And should no one rebuke you when you mock?
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For you have said, ‘My teaching is flawless,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And I am pure in your sight.’
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But if only God would speak,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If only he would open his lips against you,
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And reveal to you the secrets of wisdom—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For true wisdom has two sides—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So that you would know
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That God has forgiven some of your sins.

###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Can you discover the essence of God?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Can you find out the perfection of the Almighty?
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It is higher than the heavens—what can you do?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It is deeper than Sheol—what can you know?
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Its measure is longer than the earth,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And broader than the sea.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If he comes by and confines you
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And convenes a court,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then who can prevent him?
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For he knows deceitful men;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When he sees evil, will he not consider it?
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But an empty man will become wise,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When a wild donkey’s colt is born a human being.

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As for you, if you prove faithful,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And if you stretch out your hands toward him,
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If iniquity is in your hand—put it far away,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And do not let evil reside in your tents.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For then you will lift up your face
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Without blemish;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will be securely established
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And will not fear.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For you will forget your trouble;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will remember it
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like water that has flowed away.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And life will be brighter than the noonday;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Though there be darkness,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will be like the morning.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And you will be secure, because there is hope;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will be protected
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And will take your rest in safety.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will lie down with no one to make you afraid,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And many will seek your favor.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But the eyes of the wicked fail,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And escape eludes them;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their one hope is to breathe their last.”
