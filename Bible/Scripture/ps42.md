## Book 2 (Psalms 42-72)
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>As a deer longs for streams of water,
>So I long for you, O God!
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>I thirst for God,
>For the living God.
>I say, “When will I be able to go and appear in God’s presence?”
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>I cannot eat; I weep day and night.
>All day long they say to me, “Where is your God?”
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>I will remember and weep.
>For I was once walking along with the great throng to the temple of God,
>Shouting and giving thanks along with the crowd as we celebrated the holy festival.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 5
><span class=verse-first-poetry>5</span>Why are you depressed, O my soul?
>Why are you upset?
>Wait for God!
>For I will again give thanks
>To my God for his saving intervention.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>I am depressed,
>So I will pray to you while in the region of the upper Jordan,
>From Hermon, from Mount Mizar.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>One deep stream calls out to another at the sound of your waterfalls;
>All your billows and waves overwhelm me.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>By day the Lᴏʀᴅ decrees his loyal love,
>And by night he gives me a song,
>A prayer to the God of my life.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span>I will pray to God, my high ridge:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why do you ignore me?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why must I walk around mourning
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because my enemies oppress me?”
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>My enemies’ taunts cut me to the bone,
>As they say to me all day long, “Where is your God?”
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Why are you depressed, O my soul?
>Why are you upset?
>Wait for God!
>For I will again give thanks
>To my God for his saving intervention.
