## Fear God Now Because Old Age and Death Come Quickly
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>So remember your Creator in the days of your youth—
>Before the difficult days come,
>And the years draw near when you will say, “I have no pleasure in them”;
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Before the sun and the light of the moon and the stars grow dark,
>And the clouds disappear after the rain;
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>When those who keep watch over the house begin to tremble,
>And the virile men begin to stoop over,
>And the grinders begin to cease because they grow few,
>And those who look through the windows grow dim,
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>And the doors along the street are shut;
>When the sound of the grinding mill grows low,
>And one is awakened by the sound of a bird,
>And all their songs grow faint,
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>And they are afraid of heights and the dangers in the street;
>The almond blossoms grow white,
>And the grasshopper drags itself along,
>And the caper berry shrivels up—
>Because man goes to his eternal home,
>And the mourners go about in the streets—
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Before the silver cord is removed,
>Or the golden bowl is broken,
>Or the pitcher is shattered at the well,
>Or the water wheel is broken at the cistern—
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>And the dust returns to the earth as it was,
>And the life’s breath returns to God who gave it.
## Concluding Refrain: The Teacher Restates His Thesis
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Absolutely futile!” laments the Teacher,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All these things are futile!”
## Concluding Epilogue: The Teacher’s Advice is Wise
###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span>Not only was the Teacher wise,
>But he also taught knowledge to the people;
>He carefully evaluated and arranged many proverbs.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>The Teacher sought to find delightful words,
>And to write accurately truthful sayings.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
><span class=verse-first-poetry>11</span>The words of the sages are like prods,
>And the collected sayings are like firmly fixed nails;
>They are given by one shepherd.
## Concluding Exhortation: Fear God and Obey His Commands
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them.
>There is no end to the making of many books,
>And much study is exhausting to the body.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span>Having heard everything, I have reached this conclusion:
>Fear God and keep his commandments,
>Because this is the whole duty of man.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>For God will evaluate every deed,
>Including every secret thing, whether good or evil.
