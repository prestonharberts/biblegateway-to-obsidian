## The Resurrection
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Now on the first day of the week, at early dawn, the women went to the tomb, taking the aromatic spices they had prepared.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>They found that the stone had been rolled away from the tomb,
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>but when they went in, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>While they were perplexed about this, suddenly two men stood beside them in dazzling attire.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>The women were terribly frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead?
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>“He is not here, but has been raised! Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee,
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.”
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>Then the women remembered his words,
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>and when they returned from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>Now it was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>But these words seemed like pure nonsense to them, and they did not believe them.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. He bent down and saw only the strips of linen cloth; then he went home, wondering what had happened.
## Jesus Walks the Road to Emmaus
###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>Now that very day two of them were on their way to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>They were talking to each other about all the things that had happened.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>While they were talking and debating these things, Jesus himself approached and began to accompany them
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>(but their eyes were kept from recognizing him).
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>Then he said to them, “What are these matters you are discussing so intently as you walk along?” And they stood still, looking sad.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who doesn’t know the things that have happened there in these days?”
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>He said to them, “What things?” “The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene,” they replied, “a man who, with his powerful deeds and words, proved to be a prophet before God and all the people;
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>“and how our chief priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death, and crucified him.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>But we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. Not only this, but it is now the third day since these things happened.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>Furthermore, some women of our group amazed us. They were at the tomb early this morning,
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>and when they did not find his body, they came back and said they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>Then some of those who were with us went to the tomb, and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see him.”
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>So he said to them, “You foolish people—how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>“Wasn’t it necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and enter into his glory?”
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them the things written about himself in all the scriptures.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 28
<span class=verse-first>28</span>So they approached the village where they were going. He acted as though he wanted to go farther,
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>but they urged him, “Stay with us, because it is getting toward evening and the day is almost done.” So he went in to stay with them.
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>When he had taken his place at the table with them, he took the bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them.
###### 31
<span class=verse-body>31</span>At this point their eyes were opened and they recognized him. Then he vanished out of their sight.
###### 32
<span class=verse-body>32</span>They said to each other, “Didn’t our hearts burn within us while he was speaking with us on the road, while he was explaining the scriptures to us?”
###### 33
<span class=verse-body>33</span>So they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem. They found the eleven and those with them gathered together
###### 34
<span class=verse-body>34</span>and saying, “The Lord has really risen, and has appeared to Simon!”
###### 35
<span class=verse-body>35</span>Then they told what had happened on the road, and how they recognized him when he broke the bread.
## Jesus Makes a Final Appearance
###### 36
<span class=verse-first>36</span>While they were saying these things, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.”
###### 37
<span class=verse-body>37</span>But they were startled and terrified, thinking they saw a ghost.
###### 38
<span class=verse-body>38</span>Then he said to them, “Why are you frightened, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?
###### 39
<span class=verse-body>39</span>“Look at my hands and my feet; it’s me! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones like you see I have.”
###### 40
<span class=verse-body>40</span>When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.
###### 41
<span class=verse-body>41</span>And while they still could not believe it (because of their joy) and were amazed, he said to them, “Do you have anything here to eat?”
###### 42
<span class=verse-body>42</span>So they gave him a piece of broiled fish,
###### 43
<span class=verse-body>43</span>and he took it and ate it in front of them.
## Jesus’ Final Commission
###### 44
<span class=verse-first>44</span>Then he said to them, “These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled.”
###### 45
<span class=verse-body>45</span>Then he opened their minds so they could understand the scriptures,
###### 46
<span class=verse-body>46</span>and said to them, “Thus it stands written that the Christ would suffer and would rise from the dead on the third day,
###### 47
<span class=verse-body>47</span>“and repentance for the forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.
###### 48
<span class=verse-body>48</span>“You are witnesses of these things.
###### 49
<span class=verse-body>49</span>“And look, I am sending you what my Father promised. But stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.”
## Jesus’ Departure
###### 50
<span class=verse-first>50</span>Then Jesus led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands, he blessed them.
###### 51
<span class=verse-body>51</span>Now during the blessing he departed and was taken up into heaven.
###### 52
<span class=verse-body>52</span>So they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,
###### 53
<span class=verse-body>53</span>and were continually in the temple courts blessing God.
