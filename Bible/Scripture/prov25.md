###### 2
><span class=verse-first-poetry>2</span>It is the glory of God to conceal a matter,
>And it is the glory of a king to search out a matter.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>As the heaven is high and the earth is deep

>And his throne will be established in righteousness.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Do not honor yourself before the king,
>And do not stand in the place of great men;
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>For it is better for him to say to you, “Come up here,”

>Whom your eyes have seen.

><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>When you argue a case with your neighbor,
