## Job’s Good Life
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. And that man was blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>Seven sons and three daughters were born to him.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>His possessions included 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, and 500 female donkeys; in addition he had a very great household. Thus he was the greatest of all the people in the east.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>Now his sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one in turn, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>When the days of their feasting were finished, Job would send for them and sanctify them; he would get up early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job thought, “Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s customary practice.
## Satan’s Accusation of Job
###### 6
<span class=verse-first>6</span>Now the day came when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lᴏʀᴅ—and Satan also arrived among them.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” And Satan answered the Lᴏʀᴅ, “From roving about on the earth, and from walking back and forth across it.”
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>So the Lᴏʀᴅ said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil.”
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>Then Satan answered the Lᴏʀᴅ, “Is it for nothing that Job fears God?
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“Have you not made a hedge around him and his household and all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock have increased in the land.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>“But extend your hand and strike everything he has, and he will no doubt curse you to your face!”
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>So the Lᴏʀᴅ said to Satan, “All right then, everything he has is in your power. Only do not extend your hand against the man himself!” So Satan went out from the presence of the Lᴏʀᴅ.
## Job’s Integrity in Adversity
###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>Now the day came when Job’s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>and a messenger came to Job, saying, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing beside them,
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>“and the Sabeans swooped down and carried them all away, and they killed the servants with the sword! And I—only I alone—escaped to tell you!”
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>While this one was still speaking, another messenger arrived and said, “The fire of God has fallen from heaven and has burned up the sheep and the servants—it has consumed them! And I—only I alone—escaped to tell you!”
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>While this one was still speaking another messenger arrived and said, “The Chaldeans formed three bands and made a raid on the camels and carried them all away, and they killed the servants with the sword! And I—only I alone—escaped to tell you!”
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>While this one was still speaking another messenger arrived and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>“and suddenly a great wind swept across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people, and they died! And I—only I alone—escaped to tell you!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 20
<span class=verse-first>20</span>Then Job got up and tore his robe. He shaved his head, and then he threw himself down with his face to the ground.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>He said, “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked I will return there. The Lᴏʀᴅ gives, and the Lᴏʀᴅ takes away. May the name of the Lᴏʀᴅ be blessed!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 22
<span class=verse-first>22</span>In all this Job did not sin, nor did he charge God with moral impropriety.
