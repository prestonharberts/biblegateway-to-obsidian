###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Fools say to themselves, “There is no God.”
>They sin and commit evil deeds;
>None of them does what is right.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ looks down from heaven at the human race,
>To see if there is anyone who is wise and seeks God.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Everyone rejects God;
>They are all morally corrupt.
>None of them does what is right,
>Not even one.

###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span>All those who behave wickedly do not understand—
>Those who devour my people as if they were eating bread,
>And do not call out to the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>They are absolutely terrified,
>For God defends the godly.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>You want to humiliate the oppressed,
>Even though the Lᴏʀᴅ is their shelter.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span>I wish the deliverance of Israel would come from Zion!
>When the Lᴏʀᴅ restores the well-being of his people,
>May Jacob rejoice,
>May Israel be happy!
