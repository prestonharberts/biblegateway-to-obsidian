<span class=verse-first>1</span>Elihu answered:

###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Listen to my words, you wise men;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Hear me, you learned men.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the ear assesses words
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As the mouth tastes food.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let us evaluate for ourselves what is right;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let us come to know among ourselves what is good.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For Job says, ‘I am innocent,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>But God turns away my right.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Concerning my right, should I lie?
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>My wound is incurable,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Although I am without transgression.’
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who is there like Job,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who drinks derision like water?
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He goes about in company with evildoers,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He goes along with wicked men.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For he says, ‘It does not profit a man
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>When he makes his delight with God.’
## God is Not Unjust
###### 10
><span class=verse-first-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Therefore, listen to me, you men of understanding.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Far be it from God to do wickedness,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>From the Almighty to do evil.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For he repays a person for his work,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And according to the conduct of a person,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He causes the consequences to find him.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, in truth, God does not act wickedly,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the Almighty does not pervert justice.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who entrusted to him the earth?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And who put him over the whole world?
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If God were to set his heart on it,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And gather in his spirit and his breath,
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All flesh would perish together
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And human beings would return to dust.”
## God Is Impartial and Omniscient
###### 16
><span class=verse-first-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If you have understanding, listen to this,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Hear what I have to say.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do you really think
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That one who hates justice can govern?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And will you declare guilty
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The supremely Righteous One,
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who says to a king, ‘Worthless man,’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And to nobles, ‘Wicked men,’
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who shows no partiality to princes,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And does not take note of the rich more than the poor,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because all of them are the work of his hands?
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In a moment they die, in the middle of the night,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>People are shaken and they pass away.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The mighty are removed effortlessly.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 21
><span class=verse-first-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For his eyes are on the ways of an individual,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He observes all a person’s steps.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There is no darkness, and no deep darkness,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Where evildoers can hide themselves.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For he does not still consider a person,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That he should come before God in judgment.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He shatters the great without inquiry,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And sets up others in their place.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Therefore, he knows their deeds,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He overthrows them in the night
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And they are crushed.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He strikes them for their wickedness,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In a place where people can see,
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because they have turned away from following him,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And have not understood any of his ways,
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So that they caused the cry of the poor
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To come before him,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So that he hears the cry of the needy.
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But if God is quiet, who can condemn him?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If he hides his face, then who can see him?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yet he is over the individual and the nation alike,
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So that the godless man should not rule,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And not lay snares for the people.”
## Job Is Foolish to Rebel
###### 31
><span class=verse-first-poetry>31</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Has anyone said to God,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I have endured chastisement,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>But I will not act wrongly any more;
###### 32
><span class=verse-body-poetry>32</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Teach me what I cannot see;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>If I have done evil, I will do so no more’?
###### 33
><span class=verse-body-poetry>33</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is it your opinion that God should recompense it,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because you reject this?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But you must choose, and not I,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So tell us what you know.
###### 34
><span class=verse-body-poetry>34</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Men of understanding say to me—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Any wise man listening to me says—
###### 35
><span class=verse-body-poetry>35</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That Job speaks without knowledge
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And his words are without understanding.
###### 36
><span class=verse-body-poetry>36</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But Job will be tested to the end,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because his answers are like those of wicked men.
###### 37
><span class=verse-body-poetry>37</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For he adds transgression to his sin;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In our midst he claps his hands,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And multiplies his words against God.”
