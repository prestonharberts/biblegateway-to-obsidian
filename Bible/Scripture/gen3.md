## The Temptation and the Fall
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Now the serpent was shrewder than any of the wild animals that the Lᴏʀᴅ God had made. He said to the woman, “Is it really true that God said, ‘You must not eat from any tree of the orchard’?”
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit from the trees of the orchard;
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“but concerning the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the orchard God said, ‘You must not eat from it, and you must not touch it, or else you will die.’”
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>The serpent said to the woman, “Surely you will not die,
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“for God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will open and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>When the woman saw that the tree produced fruit that was good for food, was attractive to the eye, and was desirable for making one wise, she took some of its fruit and ate it. She also gave some of it to her husband who was with her, and he ate it.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>Then the eyes of both of them opened, and they knew they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.
## The Judgment Oracles of God at the Fall
###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lᴏʀᴅ God moving about in the orchard at the breezy time of the day, and they hid from the Lᴏʀᴅ God among the trees of the orchard.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>But the Lᴏʀᴅ God called to the man and said to him, “Where are you?”
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>The man replied, “I heard you moving about in the orchard, and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid.”
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>And the Lᴏʀᴅ God said, “Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>The man said, “The woman whom you gave me, she gave me some fruit from the tree and I ate it.”
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>So the Lᴏʀᴅ God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?” And the woman replied, “The serpent tricked me, and I ate.”
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ God said to the serpent,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because you have done this,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Cursed are you above all the cattle
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And all the living creatures of the field!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>On your belly you will crawl
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And dust you will eat all the days of your life.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I will put hostility between you and the woman
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And between your offspring and her offspring;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will strike your head,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And you will strike his heel.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>To the woman he said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will greatly increase your labor pains;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>With pain you will give birth to children.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will want to control your husband,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But he will dominate you.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>But to Adam he said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because you obeyed your wife
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And ate from the tree about which I commanded you,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You must not eat from it,’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The ground is cursed because of you;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will produce thorns and thistles for you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But you will eat the grain of the field.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>By the sweat of your brow you will eat food
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Until you return to the ground,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For out of it you were taken;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For you are dust, and to dust you will return.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 20
<span class=verse-first>20</span>The man named his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all the living.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ God made garments from skin for Adam and his wife, and clothed them.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 22
<span class=verse-first>22</span>And the Lᴏʀᴅ God said, “Now that the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil, he must not be allowed to stretch out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.”
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>So the Lᴏʀᴅ God expelled him from the orchard in Eden to cultivate the ground from which he had been taken.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>When he drove the man out, he placed on the eastern side of the orchard in Eden angelic sentries who used the flame of a whirling sword to guard the way to the tree of life.
