## Delivery of the Exiles
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Listen to me, you coastlands!
>Pay attention, you people who live far away!
>The Lᴏʀᴅ summoned me from birth;
>He commissioned me when my mother brought me into the world.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>He made my mouth like a sharp sword,
>He hid me in the hollow of his hand;
>He made me like a sharpened arrow,
>He hid me in his quiver.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>He said to me, “You are my servant,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Israel, through whom I will reveal my splendor.”
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>But I thought, “I have worked in vain;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have expended my energy for absolutely nothing.”
>But the Lᴏʀᴅ will vindicate me;
>My God will reward me.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 5
><span class=verse-first-poetry>5</span>So now the Lᴏʀᴅ says,
>The one who formed me from birth to be his servant—
>He did this to restore Jacob to himself,
>So that Israel might be gathered to him;
>And I will be honored in the Lᴏʀᴅ’s sight,
>For my God is my source of strength—
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>He says, “Is it too insignificant a task for you to be my servant,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To reestablish the tribes of Jacob,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And restore the remnant of Israel?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will make you a light to the nations,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So you can bring my deliverance to the remote regions of the earth.”
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ,
>The Protector of Israel, their Holy One, says
>To the one who is despised and rejected by nations,
>A servant of rulers:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Kings will see and rise in respect,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Princes will bow down,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because of the faithful Lᴏʀᴅ,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Holy One of Israel who has chosen you.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>At the time I decide to show my favor, I will respond to you;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In the day of deliverance I will help you;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will protect you and make you a covenant mediator for people,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To rebuild the land
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And to reassign the desolate property.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will say to the prisoners, ‘Come out,’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And to those who are in dark dungeons, ‘Emerge.’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will graze beside the roads;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>On all the slopes they will find pasture.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will not be hungry or thirsty;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The sun’s oppressive heat will not beat down on them,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For one who has compassion on them will guide them;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will lead them to springs of water.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will make all my mountains into a road;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will construct my roadways.”
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Look, they come from far away!
>Look, some come from the north and west,
>And others from the land of Sinim.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>Shout for joy, O sky!
>Rejoice, O earth!
>Let the mountains give a joyful shout!
>For the Lᴏʀᴅ consoles his people
>And shows compassion to the oppressed.
## The Lord Remembers Zion
###### 14
><span class=verse-first-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Zion said, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ has abandoned me,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The Lord has forgotten me.’
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Can a woman forget her baby who nurses at her breast?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Can she withhold compassion from the child she has borne?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even if mothers were to forget,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I could never forget you!
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, I have inscribed your name on my palms;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your walls are constantly before me.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your children hurry back,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>While those who destroyed and devastated you depart.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look all around you!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All of them gather to you.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As surely as I live,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will certainly wear all of them like jewelry;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will put them on as if you were a bride.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yes, your land lies in ruins;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It is desolate and devastated.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But now you will be too small to hold your residents,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And those who devoured you will be far away.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yet the children born during your time of bereavement
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will say within your hearing,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>This place is too cramped for us,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Make room for us so we can live here.’
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then you will think to yourself,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Who bore these children for me?
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I was bereaved and barren,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Dismissed and divorced.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Who raised these children?
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Look, I was left all alone;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Where did these children come from?’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 22
<span class=verse-first>22</span>This is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look I will raise my hand to the nations;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will raise my signal flag to the peoples.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will bring your sons in their arms
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And carry your daughters on their shoulders.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Kings will be your children’s guardians;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their princesses will nurse your children.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>With their faces to the ground they will bow down to you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And they will lick the dirt on your feet.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then you will recognize that I am the Lᴏʀᴅ;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those who wait patiently for me are not put to shame.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 24
><span class=verse-first-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Can spoils be taken from a warrior,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or captives be rescued from a conqueror?
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Captives will be taken from a warrior;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Spoils will be rescued from a conqueror.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will oppose your adversary
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I will rescue your children.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will get drunk on their own blood, as if it were wine.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then all humankind will recognize that
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I am the Lᴏʀᴅ, your Deliverer,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your Protector, the Powerful One of Jacob.”
