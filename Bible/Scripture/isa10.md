###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Beware, those who enact unjust policies;
>Those who are always instituting unfair regulations,
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>To keep the poor from getting fair treatment,
>And to deprive the oppressed among my people of justice,
>So they can steal what widows own,
>And loot what belongs to orphans.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>What will you do on judgment day,
>When destruction arrives from a distant place?
>To whom will you run for help?
>Where will you leave your wealth?
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>You will have no place to go, except to kneel with the prisoners,
>Or to fall among those who have been killed.
>Despite all this, his anger does not subside,
>And his hand is ready to strike again.
## The Lord Turns on Arrogant Assyria
###### 5
><span class=verse-first-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Beware, Assyria, the club I use to vent my anger,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A cudgel with which I angrily punish.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I sent him against a godless nation,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I ordered him to attack the people with whom I was angry,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To take plunder and to carry away loot,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To trample them down like dirt in the streets.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But he does not agree with this;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His mind does not reason this way,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For his goal is to destroy,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And to eliminate many nations.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, he says:
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Are not my officials all kings?
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Is not Calneh like Carchemish?
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Hamath like Arpad?
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Samaria like Damascus?
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I overpowered kingdoms ruled by idols,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Whose carved images were more impressive than Jerusalem’s or Samaria’s.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>As I have done to Samaria and its idols,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>So I will do to Jerusalem and its idols.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 12
<span class=verse-first>12</span>‘But when the Lord finishes judging Mount Zion and Jerusalem, then he will punish the king of Assyria for what he has proudly planned and for the arrogant attitude he displays.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>‘For he says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>By my strong hand I have accomplished this,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>By my strategy that I devised.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I invaded the territory of nations,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And looted their storehouses.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a mighty conqueror, I brought down rulers.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My hand discovered the wealth of the nations, as if it were in a nest,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As one gathers up abandoned eggs,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I gathered up the whole earth.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There was no wing flapping,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or open mouth chirping.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
><span class=verse-first-poetry>15</span>Does an ax exalt itself over the one who wields it,
>Or a saw magnify itself over the one who cuts with it?
>As if a scepter should brandish the one who raises it,
>Or a staff should lift up what is not made of wood!
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>For this reason the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies
>Will make his healthy ones emaciated.
>His majestic glory will go up in smoke.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>The Light of Israel will become a fire,
>Their Holy One will become a flame;
>It will burn and consume the Assyrian king’s briers
>And his thorns in one day.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>The splendor of his forest and his orchard
>Will be completely destroyed,
>As when a sick man’s life ebbs away.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>There will be so few trees left in his forest,
>A child will be able to count them.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 20
<span class=verse-first>20</span>At that time those left in Israel, those who remain of the family of Jacob, will no longer rely on a foreign leader that abuses them. Instead they will truly rely on the Lᴏʀᴅ, the Holy One of Israel.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>A remnant will come back, a remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>For though your people, Israel, are as numerous as the sand on the seashore, only a remnant will come back. Destruction has been decreed; just punishment is about to engulf you.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>The Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies is certainly ready to carry out the decreed destruction throughout the land.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 24
<span class=verse-first>24</span>So here is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies says: “My people who live in Zion, do not be afraid of Assyria, even though they beat you with a club and lift their cudgel against you as Egypt did.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>“For very soon my fury will subside, and my anger will be directed toward their destruction.”
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies is about to beat them with a whip, similar to the way he struck down Midian at the rock of Oreb. He will use his staff against the sea, lifting it up as he did in Egypt.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span>At that time
>The Lᴏʀᴅ will remove their burden from your shoulders,
>And their yoke from your neck;
>The yoke will be taken off because your neck will be too large.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 28
><span class=verse-first-poetry>28</span>They attacked Aiath,
>Moved through Migron,
>Depositing their supplies at Micmash.
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span>They went through the pass,
>Spent the night at Geba.
>Ramah trembled,
>Gibeah of Saul ran away.
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span>Shout out, daughter of Gallim!
>Pay attention, Laishah!
>Answer her, Anathoth!
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span>Madmenah flees,
>The residents of Gebim have hidden.
###### 32
><span class=verse-body-poetry>32</span>This very day, standing in Nob,
>They shake their fist at Daughter Zion’s mountain—
>At the hill of Jerusalem.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 33
><span class=verse-first-poetry>33</span>Look, the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies
>Is ready to cut off the branches with terrifying power.
>The tallest trees will be cut down,
>The loftiest ones will be brought low.
###### 34
><span class=verse-body-poetry>34</span>The thickets of the forest will be chopped down with an ax,
>And mighty Lebanon will fall.
