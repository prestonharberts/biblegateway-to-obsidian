###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ told me, “Go down to the palace of the king of Judah. Give him a message from me there.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“Say: ‘Listen, O king of Judah who follows in David’s succession. You, your officials, and your subjects who pass through the gates of this palace must listen to the Lord’s message.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>‘The Lᴏʀᴅ says, “Do what is just and right. Deliver those who have been robbed from those who oppress them. Do not exploit or mistreat resident foreigners who live in your land, children who have no fathers, or widows. Do not kill innocent people in this land.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>‘If you are careful to obey these commands, then the kings who follow in David’s succession and ride in chariots or on horses will continue to come through the gates of this palace, as will their officials and their subjects.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>‘But, if you do not obey these commands, I solemnly swear that this palace will become a pile of rubble. I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm it!”’
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>“For the Lᴏʀᴅ says concerning the palace of the king of Judah,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>‘This place looks like a veritable forest of Gilead to me.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>It is like the wooded heights of Lebanon in my eyes.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>But I swear that I will make it like a wilderness
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Whose towns have all been deserted.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will send men against it to destroy it
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>With their axes and hatchets.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They will hack up its fine cedar panels and columns
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And throw them into the fire.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>“‘People from other nations will pass by this city. They will ask one another, “Why has the Lᴏʀᴅ done such a thing to this great city?”
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>‘The answer will come back, “It is because they broke their covenant with the Lᴏʀᴅ their God and worshiped and served other gods.”’
## Judgment on Jehoahaz
###### 10
><span class=verse-first-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Do not weep for the king who was killed.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Do not grieve for him.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>But weep mournfully for the king who has gone into exile.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For he will never return to see his native land again.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>“‘For the Lᴏʀᴅ has spoken about Shallum son of Josiah, who succeeded his father as king of Judah but was carried off into exile. He has said, “He will never return to this land.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>‘For he will die in the country where they took him as a captive. He will never see this land again.”’
## Judgment on Jehoiakim
###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Sure to be judged is the king who builds his palace using injustice
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And treats people unfairly while adding its upper rooms.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He makes his countrymen work for him for nothing.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He does not pay them for their labor.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He says, “I will build myself a large palace
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>With spacious upper rooms.”
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He cuts windows in its walls,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Panels it with cedar, and paints its rooms red.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Does it make you any more of a king
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>That you outstrip everyone else in building with cedar?
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Just think about your father.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He was content that he had food and drink.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He did what was just and right.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>So things went well with him.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He upheld the cause of the poor and needy.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>So things went well for Judah.’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ says,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>That is a good example of what it means to know me.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>But you are always thinking and looking
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For ways to increase your wealth by dishonest means.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Your eyes and your heart are set
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>On killing some innocent person
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And committing fraud and oppression.’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span>So the Lᴏʀᴅ has this to say about Josiah’s son, King Jehoiakim of Judah:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>People will not mourn for him, saying,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>This makes me sad, my brother!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>This makes me sad, my sister!’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will not mourn for him, saying,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Poor, poor lord! Poor, poor majesty!’
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will be left unburied just like a dead donkey.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His body will be dragged off and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem.”
## Warning to Jerusalem
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>People of Jerusalem, go up to Lebanon and cry out in mourning.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Go to the land of Bashan and cry out loudly.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Cry out in mourning from the mountains of Moab.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For your allies have all been defeated.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>While you were feeling secure I gave you warning.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But you said, ‘I refuse to listen to you.’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That is the way you have acted from your earliest history onward.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, you have never paid attention to me.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My judgment will carry off all your leaders like a storm wind!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your allies will go into captivity.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then you will certainly be disgraced and put to shame
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because of all the wickedness you have done.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You may feel as secure as a bird
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Nesting in the cedars of Lebanon.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But O how you will groan when the pains of judgment come on you.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will be like those of a woman giving birth to a baby.”
## Jeconiah Will Be Permanently Exiled
###### 24
<span class=verse-first>24</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ says, “As surely as I am the living God, you, Jeconiah, king of Judah, son of Jehoiakim, will not be the earthly representative of my authority. Indeed, I will take that right away from you.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>“I will hand you over to those who want to take your life and of whom you are afraid. I will hand you over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and his Babylonian soldiers.
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>“I will force you and your mother who gave you birth into exile. You will be exiled to a country where neither of you were born, and you will both die there.
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>“You will never come back to this land that you will long to return to!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>This man, Jeconiah, will be like a broken pot someone threw away.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will be like a clay vessel that no one wants.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why will he and his children be forced into exile?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why will they be thrown out into a country they know nothing about?
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>O Land, land, land of Judah!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Listen to the Lᴏʀᴅ’s message.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>“The Lᴏʀᴅ says,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Enroll this man in the register as though he were childless.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Enroll him as a man who will not enjoy success during his lifetime.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For none of his sons will succeed in occupying the throne of David
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or ever succeed in ruling over Judah.”
