###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Who would have believed what we just heard?
>When was the Lᴏʀᴅ’s power revealed through him?
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>He sprouted up like a twig before God,
>Like a root out of parched soil;
>He had no stately form or majesty that might catch our attention,
>No special appearance that we should want to follow him.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>He was despised and rejected by people,
>One who experienced pain and was acquainted with illness;
>People hid their faces from him;
>He was despised, and we considered him insignificant.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span>But he lifted up our illnesses,
>He carried our pain;
>Even though we thought he was being punished,
>Attacked by God, and afflicted for something he had done.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>He was wounded because of our rebellious deeds,
>Crushed because of our sins;
>He endured punishment that made us well;
>Because of his wounds we have been healed.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>All of us had wandered off like sheep;
>Each of us had strayed off on his own path,
>But the Lᴏʀᴅ caused the sin of all of us to attack him.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span>He was treated harshly and afflicted,
>But he did not even open his mouth.
>Like a lamb led to the slaughtering block,
>Like a sheep silent before her shearers,
>He did not even open his mouth.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>He was led away after an unjust trial—
>But who even cared?
>Indeed, he was cut off from the land of the living;
>Because of the rebellion of his own people he was wounded.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>They intended to bury him with criminals,
>But he ended up in a rich man’s tomb,
>Because he had committed no violent deeds,
>Nor had he spoken deceitfully.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
><span class=verse-first-poetry>10</span>Though the Lᴏʀᴅ desired to crush him and make him ill,
>Once restitution is made,
>He will see descendants and enjoy long life,
>And the Lᴏʀᴅ’s purpose will be accomplished through him.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Having suffered, he will reflect on his work,
>He will be satisfied when he understands what he has done.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My servant will acquit many,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For he carried their sins.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So I will assign him a portion with the multitudes,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will divide the spoils of victory with the powerful,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because he willingly submitted to death
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And was numbered with the rebels,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When he lifted up the sin of many
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And intervened on behalf of the rebels.”
