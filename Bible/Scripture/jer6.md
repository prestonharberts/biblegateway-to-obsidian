## The Destruction of Jerusalem Depicted
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Run for safety, people of Benjamin!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Get out of Jerusalem!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Sound the trumpet in Tekoa!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Light the signal fires at Beth Hakkerem!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For disaster lurks out of the north;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will bring great destruction.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will destroy Daughter Zion,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who is as delicate and defenseless as a young maiden.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Kings will attack her with their armies.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will encamp in siege all around her.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Each of them will devastate the portion assigned to him.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will say, ‘Prepare to do battle against it!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Come on! Let’s attack it at noon!’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But later they will say, ‘Woe to us!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For the day is almost over,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And the shadows of evening are getting long.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>So come on, let’s go ahead and attack it by night
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And destroy all its fortified buildings.’
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All this is because the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies has said:
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Cut down the trees around Jerusalem
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And build up a siege ramp against its walls.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>This is the city that is to be punished.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Nothing but oppression happens in it.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>As a well continually pours out fresh water
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>So it continually pours out wicked deeds.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Sounds of violence and destruction echo throughout it.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>All I see are sick and wounded people.’
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So take warning, Jerusalem,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or I will abandon you in disgust
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And make you desolate,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A place where no one can live.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
<span class=verse-first>9</span>This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies said to me:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those who remain in Israel will be
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like the grapes thoroughly gleaned from a vine.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So go over them again, as though you were a grape harvester
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Passing your hand over the branches one last time.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>I answered,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who would listen
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If I spoke to them and warned them?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their ears are so closed
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That they cannot hear!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, the Lord’s message is offensive to them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They do not like it at all.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I am as full of anger as you are, Lᴏʀᴅ,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I am tired of trying to hold it in.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

The Lᴏʀᴅ answered,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Vent it, then, on the children who play in the street
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And on the young men who are gathered together.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Husbands and wives are to be included,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As well as the old and those who are advanced in years.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their houses will be turned over to others
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As will their fields and their wives.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I will unleash my power
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Against those who live in this land,”
>Says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That is because, from the least important to the most important of them,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All of them are greedy for dishonest gain.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Prophets and priests alike,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All of them practice deceit.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They offer only superficial help
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the harm my people have suffered.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They say, ‘Everything will be all right!’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But everything is not all right!
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Are they ashamed because they have done such shameful things?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No, they are not at all ashamed.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They do not even know how to blush!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So they will die, just like others have died.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will be brought to ruin when I punish them,”
>Says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 16
<span class=verse-first>16</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said to his people:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You are standing at the crossroads. So consider your path.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Ask where the old, reliable paths are.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Ask where the path is that leads to blessing and follow it.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If you do, you will find rest for your souls.”
>But they said, “We will not follow it!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I appointed prophets as watchmen to warn you, saying,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Pay attention to the warning sound of the trumpet!’”
>But they said, “We will not pay attention!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>So the Lᴏʀᴅ said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Hear, you nations!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Be witnesses and take note of what will happen to these people.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Hear this, you peoples of the earth:
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Take note! I am about to bring disaster on these people.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>It will come as punishment for their scheming.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For they have paid no attention to what I have said,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And they have rejected my law.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I take no delight when they offer up to me
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Frankincense that comes from Sheba
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Or sweet-smelling cane imported from a faraway land.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I cannot accept the burnt offerings they bring me.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I get no pleasure from the sacrifices they offer to me.’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>So, this is what the Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will assuredly make these people stumble to their doom.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Parents and children will stumble and fall to their destruction.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Friends and neighbors will die.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 22
<span class=verse-first>22</span>This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Beware! An army is coming from a land in the north.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A mighty nation is stirring into action in faraway parts of the earth.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Its soldiers are armed with bows and spears.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are cruel and show no mercy.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They sound like the roaring sea
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As they ride forth on their horses.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Lined up in formation like men going into battle
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To attack you, Daughter Zion.”
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span>The people cry out, “We have heard reports about them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We have become helpless with fear!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Anguish grips us,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Agony like that of a woman giving birth to a baby!
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not go out into the countryside.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not travel on the roads.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the enemy is there with sword in hand.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are spreading terror everywhere.”
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span>So I said, “Oh, my dear people, put on sackcloth
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And roll in ashes.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Mourn with painful sobs
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As though you had lost your only child.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For any moment now that destructive army
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will come against us.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 27
<span class=verse-first>27</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said to me,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have made you like a metal assayer
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To test my people like ore.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You are to observe them
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And evaluate how they behave.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>I reported,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All of them are the most stubborn of rebels!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are as hard as bronze or iron.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They go about telling lies.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They all deal corruptly.
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The fiery bellows of judgment burn fiercely.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But there is too much dross to be removed.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The process of refining them has proved useless.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The wicked have not been purged.
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are regarded as ‘rejected silver’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because the Lᴏʀᴅ rejects them.”
