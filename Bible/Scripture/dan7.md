## Daniel has a Vision of Four Animals Coming up from the Sea
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>In the first year of King Belshazzar of Babylon, Daniel had a dream filled with visions while he was lying on his bed. Then he wrote down the dream in summary fashion.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>Daniel explained: “I was watching in my vision during the night as the four winds of the sky were stirring up the great sea.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“Then four large beasts came up from the sea; they were different from one another.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“The first one was like a lion with eagles’ wings. As I watched, its wings were pulled off and it was lifted up from the ground. It was made to stand on two feet like a human being, and a human mind was given to it.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“Then a second beast appeared, like a bear. It was raised up on one side, and there were three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, ‘Get up and devour much flesh!’
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>“After these things, as I was watching, another beast like a leopard appeared, with four bird-like wings on its back. This beast had four heads, and ruling authority was given to it.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“After these things, as I was watching in the night visions a fourth beast appeared—one dreadful, terrible, and very strong. It had two large rows of iron teeth. It devoured and crushed, and anything that was left it trampled with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that came before it, and it had ten horns.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>“As I was contemplating the horns, another horn—a small one—came up between them, and three of the former horns were torn out by the roots to make room for it. This horn had eyes resembling human eyes and a mouth speaking arrogant things.

<span class=verse-first>9</span>“While I was watching,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Thrones were set up,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the Ancient of Days took his seat.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His attire was white like snow;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The hair of his head was like lamb’s wool.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His throne was ablaze with fire
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And its wheels were all aflame.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A river of fire was streaming forth
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And proceeding from his presence.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Many thousands were ministering to him;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Many tens of thousands stood ready to serve him.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The court convened
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the books were opened.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>“Then I kept on watching because of the arrogant words of the horn that was speaking. I was watching until the beast was killed and its body destroyed and thrown into the flaming fire.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>“As for the rest of the beasts, their ruling authority had already been removed, though they were permitted to go on living for a time and a season.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I was watching in the night visions,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And with the clouds of the sky
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>One like a son of man was approaching.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He went up to the Ancient of Days
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And was escorted before him.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To him was given ruling authority, honor, and sovereignty.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All peoples, nations, and language groups were serving him.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His authority is eternal and will not pass away.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His kingdom will not be destroyed.”
## An Angel Interprets Daniel’s Vision
###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>“As for me, Daniel, my spirit was distressed, and the visions of my mind were alarming me.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>“I approached one of those standing nearby and asked him about the meaning of all this. So he spoke with me and revealed to me the interpretation of the vision:
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>‘These large beasts, which are four in number, represent four kings who will arise from the earth.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>‘The holy ones of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will take possession of the kingdom forever and ever.’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 19
<span class=verse-first>19</span>“Then I wanted to know the meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others. It was very dreadful, with two rows of iron teeth and bronze claws, and it devoured, crushed, and trampled anything that was left with its feet.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>“I also wanted to know the meaning of the ten horns on its head, and of that other horn that came up and before which three others fell. This was the horn that had eyes and a mouth speaking arrogant things, whose appearance was more formidable than the others.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>“While I was watching, that horn began to wage war against the holy ones and was defeating them,
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>“until the Ancient of Days arrived and judgment was rendered in favor of the holy ones of the Most High. Then the time came for the holy ones to take possession of the kingdom.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 23
<span class=verse-first>23</span>“This is what he told me:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The fourth beast means that there will be a fourth kingdom on earth
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>That will differ from all the other kingdoms.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>It will devour all the earth
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And will trample and crush it.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The ten horns mean that ten kings
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Will arise from that kingdom.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Another king will arise after them,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>But he will be different from the earlier ones.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He will humiliate three kings.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He will speak words against the Most High.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He will harass the holy ones of the Most High continually.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>His intention will be to change times established by law.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The holy ones will be delivered into his hand
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For a time, times, and half a time.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>But the court will convene, and his ruling authority will be removed—
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Destroyed and abolished forever!
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Then the kingdom, authority,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Will be delivered to the people of the holy ones of the Most High.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>His kingdom is an eternal kingdom;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>All authorities will serve him and obey him.’

###### 28
<span class=verse-first>28</span>“This is the conclusion of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts troubled me greatly, and the color drained from my face. But I kept the matter to myself.”
