## Symbolic Visions of Judgment
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ showed me this: I saw him making locusts just as the crops planted late were beginning to sprout. (The crops planted late sprout after the royal harvest.)
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>When they had completely consumed the earth’s vegetation, I said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ, forgive Israel!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How can Jacob survive?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He is too weak!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ decided not to do this. “It will not happen,” the Lᴏʀᴅ said.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 4
<span class=verse-first>4</span>The Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ showed me this: I saw the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ summoning a shower of fire. It consumed the great deep and devoured the fields.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>I said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ, stop!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How can Jacob survive?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He is too weak!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ decided not to do this. The Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ said, “This will not happen either.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
<span class=verse-first>7</span>He showed me this: I saw the Lord standing by a tin wall holding tin in his hand.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said to me, “What do you see, Amos?” I said, “Tin.” The Lord then said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, I am about to place tin among my people Israel.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will no longer overlook their sin.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Isaac’s centers of worship will become desolate;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Israel’s holy places will be in ruins.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will attack Jeroboam’s dynasty with the sword.”
## Amos Confronts a Priest
###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent this message to King Jeroboam of Israel: “Amos is conspiring against you in the very heart of the kingdom of Israel! The land cannot endure all his prophecies.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>“As a matter of fact, Amos is saying this: ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword and Israel will certainly be carried into exile away from its land.’”
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>Amaziah then said to Amos, “Leave, you visionary! Run away to the land of Judah. Earn your living and prophesy there!
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>“Don’t prophesy at Bethel any longer, for a royal temple and palace are here.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
<span class=verse-first>14</span>Amos replied to Amaziah, “I was not a prophet by profession. No, I was a herdsman who also took care of sycamore fig trees.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>“Then the Lᴏʀᴅ took me from tending flocks and gave me this commission, ‘Go! Prophesy to my people Israel.’
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>“So now listen to the Lᴏʀᴅ’s message! You say, ‘Don’t prophesy against Israel! Don’t preach against the family of Isaac!’
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>“Therefore this is what the Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Your wife will become a prostitute in the streets
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And your sons and daughters will die violently.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Your land will be given to others
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And you will die in a foreign land.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Israel will certainly be carried into exile away from its land.’”
