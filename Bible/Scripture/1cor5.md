## Church Discipline
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>It is actually reported that sexual immorality exists among you, the kind of immorality that is not permitted even among the Gentiles, so that someone is cohabiting with his father’s wife.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>And you are proud! Shouldn’t you have been deeply sorrowful instead and removed the one who did this from among you?
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 3
<span class=verse-first>3</span>“For even though I am absent physically, I am present in spirit. And I have already judged the one who did this, just as though I were present.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“When you gather together in the name of our Lord Jesus, and I am with you in spirit, along with the power of our Lord Jesus,
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 6
<span class=verse-first>6</span>“Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know that a little yeast affects the whole batch of dough?
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“Clean out the old yeast so that you may be a new batch of dough—you are, in fact, without yeast. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>“So then, let us celebrate the festival, not with the old yeast, the yeast of vice and evil, but with the bread without yeast, the bread of sincerity and truth.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
<span class=verse-first>9</span>“I wrote you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“In no way did I mean the immoral people of this world, or the greedy and swindlers and idolaters, since you would then have to go out of the world.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>“But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who calls himself a Christian who is sexually immoral, or greedy, or an idolater, or verbally abusive, or a drunkard, or a swindler. Do not even eat with such a person.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>“For what do I have to do with judging those outside? Are you not to judge those inside?
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>“But God will judge those outside. Remove the evil person from among you.
