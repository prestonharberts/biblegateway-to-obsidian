###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>You must not sacrifice to him a bull or sheep that has a blemish or any other defect, because that is considered offensive to the Lᴏʀᴅ your God.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 2
<span class=verse-first>2</span>Suppose a man or woman is discovered among you in one of your villages that the Lᴏʀᴅ your God is giving you who sins before the Lᴏʀᴅ your God and breaks his covenant
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>by serving other gods and worshiping them—the sun, moon, or any other heavenly bodies that I have not permitted you to worship.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>When it is reported to you and you hear about it, you must investigate carefully. If it is indeed true that such a disgraceful thing is being done in Israel,
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>you must bring to your city gates that man or woman who has done this wicked thing—that very man or woman—and you must stone that person to death.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>At the testimony of two or three witnesses the person must be executed. They cannot be put to death on the testimony of only one witness.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>The witnesses must be first to begin the execution, and then all the people are to join in afterward. In this way you will purge the evil from among you.
## Appeal to a Higher Court
###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>If a matter is too difficult for you to judge—bloodshed, legal claim, or assault—matters of controversy in your villages—you must leave there and go up to the place the Lᴏʀᴅ your God chooses.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>You will go to the Levitical priests and the judge in office in those days and seek a solution; they will render a verdict.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>You must then do as they have determined at that place the Lᴏʀᴅ chooses. Be careful to do just as you are taught.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>You must do what you are instructed, and the verdict they pronounce to you, without fail. Do not deviate right or left from what they tell you.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>The person who pays no attention to the priest currently serving the Lᴏʀᴅ your God there, or to the judge—that person must die, so that you may purge evil from Israel.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>Then all the people will hear and be afraid, and not be so presumptuous again.
## Provision for Kingship
###### 14
<span class=verse-first>14</span>When you come to the land the Lᴏʀᴅ your God is giving you and take it over and live in it and then say, “I will select a king like all the nations surrounding me,”
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>you must select without fail a king whom the Lᴏʀᴅ your God chooses. From among your fellow citizens you must appoint a king—you may not designate a foreigner who is not one of your fellow Israelites.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>Moreover, he must not accumulate horses for himself or allow the people to return to Egypt to do so, for the Lᴏʀᴅ has said you must never again return that way.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>Furthermore, he must not marry many wives lest his affections turn aside, and he must not accumulate much silver and gold.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span>When he sits on his royal throne he must make a copy of this law on a scroll given to him by the Levitical priests.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>It must be with him constantly, and he must read it as long as he lives, so that he may learn to revere the Lᴏʀᴅ his God and observe all the words of this law and these statutes and carry them out.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>Then he will not exalt himself above his fellow citizens or turn from the commandments to the right or left, and he and his descendants will enjoy many years ruling over his kingdom in Israel.
