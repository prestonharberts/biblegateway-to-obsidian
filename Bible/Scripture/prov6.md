><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>My child, if you have made a pledge for your neighbor,
>If you have become a guarantor for a stranger,
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>If you have been ensnared by the words you have uttered,
>And have been caught by the words you have spoken,
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Then, my child, do this in order to deliver yourself,
>Because you have fallen into your neighbor’s power:

>And appeal firmly to your neighbor.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>Permit no sleep to your eyes

###### 6
><span class=verse-first-poetry>6</span>Go to the ant, you sluggard;
>Observe her ways and be wise!
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>It has no commander,
>Overseer, or ruler,
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Yet it would prepare its food in the summer;
>It gathered at the harvest what it will eat.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>How long, you sluggard, will you lie there?
>When will you rise from your sleep?
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>A little sleep, a little slumber,
>A little folding of the hands to relax,
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>And your poverty will come like a robber,
>And your need like an armed man.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 12
><span class=verse-first-poetry>12</span>A worthless and wicked person
>Walks around saying perverse things;
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>He winks with his eyes,
>Signals with his feet,
>And points with his fingers;
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>He plots evil with perverse thoughts in his heart,
>He spreads contention at all times.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>Therefore, his disaster will come suddenly;

<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 16
><span class=verse-first-poetry>16</span>There are six things that the Lᴏʀᴅ hates,

###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>Haughty eyes, a lying tongue,
>And hands that shed innocent blood,
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>A heart that devises wicked plans,

###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>A false witness who pours out lies,

<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 20
><span class=verse-first-poetry>20</span>My child, guard the commands of your father

###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>Bind them on your heart continually;
>Fasten them around your neck.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>When you walk about, they will guide you;
>When you lie down, they will watch over you;
>When you wake up, they will talk to you.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span>For the commandments are like a lamp,
>Instruction is like a light,
>And rebukes of discipline are like the road leading to life,
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span>By keeping you from the evil woman,
>From the smooth tongue of the loose woman.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span>Do not lust in your heart for her beauty,
>And do not let her captivate you with her alluring eyes;
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span>For on account of a prostitute one is brought down to a loaf of bread,
>But the wife of another man preys on your precious life.
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span>Can a man hold fire against his chest
>Without burning his clothes?
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span>Can a man walk on hot coals
>Without scorching his feet?
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span>So it is with the one who sleeps with his neighbor’s wife;
>No one who touches her will escape punishment.
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span>People do not despise a thief when he steals
>To fulfill his need when he is hungry.
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span>Yet if he is caught he must repay seven times over,
>He might even have to give all the wealth of his house.
###### 32
><span class=verse-body-poetry>32</span>A man who commits adultery with a woman lacks sense,
>Whoever does it destroys his own life.
###### 33
><span class=verse-body-poetry>33</span>He will be beaten and despised,
>And his reproach will not be wiped away;
###### 34
><span class=verse-body-poetry>34</span>For jealousy kindles a husband’s rage,
>And he will not show mercy when he takes revenge.
###### 35
><span class=verse-body-poetry>35</span>He will not consider any compensation;
>He will not be willing, even if you multiply the compensation.
