## The Lord Challenges the Nations
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Listen to me in silence, you coastlands!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let the nations find renewed strength!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let them approach and then speak;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let us come together for debate.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who stirs up this one from the east?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who officially commissions him for service?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He hands nations over to him,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And enables him to subdue kings.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He makes them like dust with his sword,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like windblown straw with his bow.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He pursues them and passes by unharmed;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He advances with great speed.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who acts and carries out decrees?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who summons the successive generations from the beginning?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, am present at the very beginning,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And at the very end—I am the one.

###### 5
><span class=verse-first-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The coastlands see and are afraid;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The whole earth trembles;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They approach and come.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They help one another;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>One says to the other, ‘Be strong!’
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The craftsman encourages the metalsmith,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The one who wields the hammer encourages the one who pounds on the anvil.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He approves the quality of the welding,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And nails it down so it won’t fall over.”
## The Lord Encourages His People
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You, my servant Israel,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Jacob, whom I have chosen,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Offspring of Abraham my friend,
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You whom I am bringing back from the earth’s extremities,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And have summoned from the remote regions—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I told you, ‘You are my servant.’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have chosen you and not rejected you.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Don’t be afraid, for I am with you!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Don’t be frightened, for I am your God!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I strengthen you—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yes, I help you—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yes, I uphold you with my victorious right hand!
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, all who were angry at you will be ashamed and humiliated;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your adversaries will be reduced to nothing and perish.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When you will look for your opponents, you will not find them;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your enemies will be reduced to absolutely nothing.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I am the Lᴏʀᴅ your God,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The one who takes hold of your right hand,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who says to you, ‘Don’t be afraid, I am helping you.’
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Don’t be afraid, despised insignificant Jacob,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Men of Israel.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I am helping you,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ,
>Your Protector, the Holy One of Israel.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, I am making you like a sharp threshing sledge,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>New and double-edged.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will thresh the mountains and crush them;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will make the hills like straw.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will winnow them and the wind will blow them away;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The wind will scatter them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will rejoice in the Lᴏʀᴅ;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will boast in the Holy One of Israel.

###### 17
><span class=verse-first-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The oppressed and the poor look for water, but there is none;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their tongues are parched from thirst.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, will respond to their prayers;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I, the God of Israel, will not abandon them.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will make streams flow down the slopes
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And produce springs in the middle of the valleys.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will turn the wilderness into a pool of water
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the arid land into springs.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will make cedars, acacias, myrtles, and olive trees grow in the wilderness;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will make evergreens, firs, and cypresses grow together in the arid rift valley.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will do this so people will observe and recognize,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So they will pay attention and understand
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That the Lᴏʀᴅ’s power has accomplished this,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And that the Holy One of Israel has brought it into being.”
## The Lord Challenges the Pagan Gods
###### 21
><span class=verse-first-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Present your argument,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Produce your evidence,” says Jacob’s king.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let them produce evidence! Let them tell us what will happen!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Tell us about your earlier predictive oracles,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So we may examine them and see how they were fulfilled.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or decree for us some future events!
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Predict how future events will turn out,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So we might know you are gods.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yes, do something good or something bad,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So we might be frightened and in awe.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, you are nothing, and your accomplishments are nonexistent;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The one who chooses to worship you is disgusting.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 25
><span class=verse-first-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have stirred up one out of the north and he advances,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>One from the eastern horizon who prays in my name.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He steps on rulers as if they were clay,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a potter treading the clay.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who decreed this from the beginning, so we could know?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who announced it ahead of time, so we could say, ‘He’s correct’?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, none of them decreed it.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, none of them announced it.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, no one heard you say anything!
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I first decreed to Zion, ‘Look, here’s what will happen!’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I sent a herald to Jerusalem.
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I look, but there is no one,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Among them there is no one who serves as an adviser,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That I might ask questions and receive answers.
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, all of them are nothing,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their accomplishments are nonexistent;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their metal images lack any real substance.
