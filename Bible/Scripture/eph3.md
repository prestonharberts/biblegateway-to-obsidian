## Paul’s Relationship to the Divine Mystery
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace that was given to me for you,
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I wrote before briefly.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>When reading this, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>(which was not disclosed to people in former generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit),
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>namely, that through the gospel the Gentiles are fellow heirs, fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>I became a servant of this gospel according to the gift of God’s grace that was given to me by the exercise of his power.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>To me—less than the least of all the saints—this grace was given, to proclaim to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>and to enlighten everyone about God’s secret plan—the mystery that has been hidden for ages in God who has created all things.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>The purpose of this enlightenment is that through the church the multifaceted wisdom of God should now be disclosed to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly realms.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>This was according to the eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord,
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>in whom we have boldness and confident access to God by way of Christ’s faithfulness.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>For this reason I ask you not to lose heart because of what I am suffering for you, which is your glory.
## Prayer for Strengthened Love
###### 14
<span class=verse-first>14</span>For this reason I kneel before the Father,
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>I pray that according to the wealth of his glory he will grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner person,
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>that Christ will dwell in your hearts through faith, so that, because you have been rooted and grounded in love,
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>you will be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>and thus to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you will be filled up to all the fullness of God.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 20
<span class=verse-first>20</span>Now to him who by the power that is working within us is able to do far beyond all that we ask or think,
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>to him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
