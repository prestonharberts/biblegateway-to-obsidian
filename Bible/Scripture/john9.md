## Healing a Man Born Blind
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Now as Jesus was passing by, he saw a man who had been blind from birth.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who committed the sin that caused him to be born blind, this man or his parents?”
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>Jesus answered, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but he was born blind so that the acts of God may be revealed through what happens to him.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“We must perform the deeds of the one who sent me as long as it is daytime. Night is coming when no one can work.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>Having said this, he spat on the ground and made some mud with the saliva. He smeared the mud on the blind man’s eyes
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>and said to him, “Go wash in the pool of Siloam” (which is translated “sent”). So the blind man went away and washed, and came back seeing.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>Then the neighbors and the people who had seen him previously as a beggar began saying, “Is this not the man who used to sit and beg?”
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>Some people said, “This is the man!” while others said, “No, but he looks like him.” The man himself kept insisting, “I am the one!”
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>So they asked him, “How then were you made to see?”
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>He replied, “The man called Jesus made mud, smeared it on my eyes and told me, ‘Go to Siloam and wash.’ So I went and washed, and was able to see.”
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>They said to him, “Where is that man?” He replied, “I don’t know.”
## The Pharisees’ Reaction to the Healing
###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>They brought the man who used to be blind to the Pharisees.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>(Now the day on which Jesus made the mud and caused him to see was a Sabbath.)
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>So the Pharisees asked him again how he had gained his sight. He replied, “He put mud on my eyes and I washed, and now I am able to see.”
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>Then some of the Pharisees began to say, “This man is not from God, because he does not observe the Sabbath.” But others said, “How can a man who is a sinner perform such miraculous signs?” Thus there was a division among them.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>So again they asked the man who used to be blind, “What do you say about him, since he caused you to see?” “He is a prophet,” the man replied.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span>Now the Jewish religious leaders refused to believe that he had really been blind and had gained his sight until at last they summoned the parents of the man who had become able to see.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>They asked the parents, “Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?”
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>So his parents replied, “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>“But we do not know how he is now able to see, nor do we know who caused him to see. Ask him, he is a mature adult. He will speak for himself.”
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>His parents said these things because they were afraid of the Jewish religious leaders. For the Jewish leaders had already agreed that anyone who confessed Jesus to be the Christ would be put out of the synagogue.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>For this reason his parents said, “He is a mature adult, ask him.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 24
<span class=verse-first>24</span>Then they summoned the man who used to be blind a second time and said to him, “Promise before God to tell the truth. We know that this man is a sinner.”
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>He replied, “I do not know whether he is a sinner. I do know one thing—that although I was blind, now I can see.”
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>Then they said to him, “What did he do to you? How did he cause you to see?”
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>He answered, “I told you already and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You people don’t want to become his disciples too, do you?”
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>They heaped insults on him, saying, “You are his disciple! We are disciples of Moses!
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>“We know that God has spoken to Moses! We do not know where this man comes from!”
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>The man replied, “This is a remarkable thing, that you don’t know where he comes from, and yet he caused me to see!
###### 31
<span class=verse-body>31</span>“We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners, but if anyone is devout and does his will, God listens to him.
###### 32
<span class=verse-body>32</span>“Never before has anyone heard of someone causing a man born blind to see.
###### 33
<span class=verse-body>33</span>“If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”
###### 34
<span class=verse-body>34</span>They replied, “You were born completely in sinfulness, and yet you presume to teach us?” So they threw him out.
## The Man’s Response to Jesus
###### 35
<span class=verse-first>35</span>Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, so he found the man and said to him, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”
###### 36
<span class=verse-body>36</span>The man replied, “And who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?”
###### 37
<span class=verse-body>37</span>Jesus told him, “You have seen him; he is the one speaking with you.”
###### 38
<span class=verse-body>38</span>\[He said, “Lord, I believe,” and he worshiped him.
###### 39
<span class=verse-body>39</span>Jesus said,\] “For judgment I have come into this world, so that those who do not see may gain their sight, and the ones who see may become blind.”
###### 40
<span class=verse-body>40</span>Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this and asked him, “We are not blind too, are we?”
###### 41
<span class=verse-body>41</span>Jesus replied, “If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin, but now because you claim that you can see, your guilt remains.
