###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>‘Along with the loaves of bread, you must also present seven flawless yearling lambs, one young bull, and two rams. They are to be a burnt offering to the Lᴏʀᴅ along with their grain offering and drink offerings, a gift of a soothing aroma to the Lᴏʀᴅ.

###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>“‘On this very day you must proclaim an assembly; it is to be a holy assembly for you. You must not do any regular work. This is a perpetual statute in all the places where you live throughout your generations.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 22
<span class=verse-first>22</span>‘When you gather in the harvest of your land, you must not completely harvest the corner of your field, and you must not gather up the gleanings of your harvest. You must leave them for the poor and the resident foreigner. I am the Lᴏʀᴅ your God.’”
## The Feast of Horn Blasts
###### 23
<span class=verse-first>23</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ spoke to Moses:
###### 24

<span class=verse-first>26</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ spoke to Moses:
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>“The tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement. It is to be a holy assembly for you, and you must humble yourselves and present a gift to the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>“You must not do any work on this particular day, because it is a day of atonement to make atonement for yourselves before the Lᴏʀᴅ your God.

## The Feast of Temporary Shelters
###### 33
<span class=verse-first>33</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ spoke to Moses:
###### 34
<span class=verse-body>34</span>“Tell the Israelites, ‘On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the Feast of Shelters for seven days to the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 35
<span class=verse-body>35</span>‘On the first day is a holy assembly; you must do no regular work.
###### 36
<span class=verse-body>36</span>‘For seven days you must present a gift to the Lᴏʀᴅ. On the eighth day there is to be a holy assembly for you, and you must present a gift to the Lᴏʀᴅ. It is a solemn assembly day; you must not do any regular work.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 37
<span class=verse-first>37</span>“‘These are the appointed times of the Lᴏʀᴅ that you must proclaim as holy assemblies to present a gift to the Lᴏʀᴅ—burnt offering, grain offering, sacrifice, and drink offerings, each day according to its regulation,
###### 38
<span class=verse-body>38</span>‘besides the Sabbaths of the Lᴏʀᴅ and all your gifts, votive offerings, and freewill offerings which you must give to the Lᴏʀᴅ.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 39
<span class=verse-first>39</span>“‘On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you gather in the produce of the land, you must celebrate a pilgrim festival of the Lᴏʀᴅ for seven days. On the first day is a complete rest and on the eighth day is complete rest.
###### 40
<span class=verse-body>40</span>‘On the first day you must take for yourselves branches from majestic trees—palm branches, branches of leafy trees, and willows of the brook—and you must rejoice before the Lᴏʀᴅ your God for seven days.
###### 41
<span class=verse-body>41</span>‘You must celebrate it as a pilgrim festival to the Lᴏʀᴅ for seven days in the year. This is a perpetual statute throughout your generations; you must celebrate it in the seventh month.
###### 42
<span class=verse-body>42</span>‘You must live in temporary shelters for seven days; every native citizen in Israel must live in shelters,
###### 43
<span class=verse-body>43</span>‘so that your future generations may know that I made the Israelites live in shelters when I brought them out from the land of Egypt. I am the Lᴏʀᴅ your God.’”
###### 44
<span class=verse-body>44</span>So Moses spoke to the Israelites about the appointed times of the Lᴏʀᴅ.
