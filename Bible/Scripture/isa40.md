## The Lord Returns to Jerusalem
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Comfort, comfort my people,”
>Says your God.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Speak kindly to Jerusalem and tell her
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That her time of warfare is over,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That her punishment is completed.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ has made her pay double for all her sins.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 3
><span class=verse-first-poetry>3</span>A voice cries out,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In the wilderness clear a way for the Lᴏʀᴅ;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Build a level road through the rift valley for our God.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Every valley must be elevated,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And every mountain and hill leveled.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The rough terrain will become a level plain,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The rugged landscape a wide valley.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The splendor of the Lᴏʀᴅ will be revealed,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And all people will see it at the same time.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ has decreed it.”
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>A voice says, “Cry out!”
>Another asks, “What should I cry out?”
>The first voice responds: “All people are like grass,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And all their promises are like the flowers in the field.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The grass dries up,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The flowers wither,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When the wind sent by the Lᴏʀᴅ blows on them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Surely humanity is like grass.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The grass dries up,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The flowers wither,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But the decree of our God is forever reliable.”

###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span>Go up on a high mountain, O herald Zion.
>Shout out loudly, O herald Jerusalem!
>Shout, don’t be afraid!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Say to the towns of Judah,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Here is your God!”
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Look, the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ comes as a victorious warrior;
>His military power establishes his rule.
>Look, his reward is with him;
>His prize goes before him.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Like a shepherd he tends his flock;
>He gathers up the lambs with his arm;
>He carries them close to his heart;
>He leads the ewes along.
## The Lord is Incomparable
###### 12
><span class=verse-first-poetry>12</span>Who has measured out the waters in the hollow of his hand,
>Or carefully measured the sky,
>Or carefully weighed the soil of the earth,
>Or weighed the mountains in a balance,
>Or the hills on scales?
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>Who comprehends the mind of the Lᴏʀᴅ,
>Or gives him instruction as his counselor?
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>From whom does he receive directions?
>Who teaches him the correct way to do things,
>Or imparts knowledge to him,
>Or instructs him in skillful design?
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>Look, the nations are like a drop in a bucket;
>They are regarded as dust on the scales.
>He lifts the coastlands as if they were dust.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>Not even Lebanon could supply enough firewood for a sacrifice;
>Its wild animals would not provide enough burnt offerings.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>All the nations are insignificant before him;
>They are regarded as absolutely nothing.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
><span class=verse-first-poetry>18</span>To whom can you compare God?
>To what image can you liken him?
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>A craftsman casts an idol;
>A metalsmith overlays it with gold
>And forges silver chains for it.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>To make a contribution one selects wood that will not rot;
>He then seeks a skilled craftsman
>To make an idol that will not fall over.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 21
><span class=verse-first-poetry>21</span>Do you not know?
>Do you not hear?
>Has it not been told to you since the very beginning?
>Have you not understood from the time the earth’s foundations were made?
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>He is the one who sits on the earth’s horizon;
>Its inhabitants are like grasshoppers before him.
>He is the one who stretches out the sky like a thin curtain,
>And spreads it out like a pitched tent.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span>He is the one who reduces rulers to nothing;
>He makes the earth’s leaders insignificant.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span>Indeed, they are barely planted;
>Yes, they are barely sown;
>Yes, they barely take root in the earth,
>And then he blows on them, causing them to dry up,
>And the wind carries them away like straw.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To whom can you compare me? Whom do I resemble?”
>Says the Holy One.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span>Look up at the sky!
>Who created all these heavenly lights?
>He is the one who leads out their ranks;
>He calls them all by name.
>Because of his absolute power and awesome strength,
>Not one of them is missing.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 27
><span class=verse-first-poetry>27</span>Why do you say, Jacob,
>Why do you say, Israel,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ is not aware of what is happening to me;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My God is not concerned with my vindication”?
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span>Do you not know?
>Have you not heard?
>The Lᴏʀᴅ is an eternal God,
>The Creator of the whole earth.
>He does not get tired or weary;
>There is no limit to his wisdom.
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span>He gives strength to those who are tired;
>To the ones who lack power, he gives renewed energy.
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span>Even youths get tired and weary;
>Even strong young men clumsily stumble.
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span>But those who wait for the Lᴏʀᴅ’s help find renewed strength;
>They rise up as if they had eagles’ wings,
>They run without growing weary,
>They walk without getting tired.
