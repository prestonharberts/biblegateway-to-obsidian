## An Object Lesson from the Making of Pottery
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said to Jeremiah:
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“Go down at once to the potter’s house. I will speak to you further there.”
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>So I went down to the potter’s house and found him working at his wheel.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>Now and then there would be something wrong with the pot he was molding from the clay with his hands. So he would rework the clay into another kind of pot as he saw fit.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 5
<span class=verse-first>5</span>Then the Lord’s message came to me,
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>“I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, say: ‘O nation of Israel, can I not deal with you as this potter deals with the clay? In my hands, you, O nation of Israel, are just like the clay in this potter’s hand.’
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“There are times, Jeremiah, when I threaten to uproot, tear down, and destroy a nation or kingdom.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>“But if that nation I threatened stops doing wrong, I will cancel the destruction I intended to do to it.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>“And there are times when I promise to build up and establish a nation or kingdom.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“But if that nation does what displeases me and does not obey me, then I will cancel the good I promised to do to it.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>“So now, tell the people of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem this: The Lᴏʀᴅ says, ‘I am preparing to bring disaster on you! I am making plans to punish you. So, every one of you, stop the evil things you have been doing. Correct the way you have been living and do what is right.’
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>“But they just keep saying, ‘We do not care what you say! We will do whatever we want to do! We will continue to behave wickedly and stubbornly!’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>Therefore, the Lᴏʀᴅ says,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Ask the people of other nations
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Whether they have heard of anything like this.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Israel should have been like a virgin,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But she has done something utterly revolting!
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Does the snow ever completely vanish from the rocky slopes of Lebanon?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do the cool waters from those distant mountains ever cease to flow?
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yet my people have forgotten me
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And offered sacrifices to worthless idols.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>This makes them stumble along in the way they live
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And leave the old reliable path of their fathers.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They have left them to walk in bypaths,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In roads that are not smooth and level.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So their land will become an object of horror.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>People will forever hiss out their scorn over it.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All who pass that way will be filled with horror
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And will shake their heads in derision.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will scatter them before their enemies
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like dust blowing in front of a burning east wind.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will turn my back on them and not look favorably on them
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When disaster strikes them.”
## Jeremiah Petitions the Lord to Punish Those Who Attack Him
###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span>Then some people said, “Come on! Let us consider how to deal with Jeremiah! There will still be priests to instruct us, wise men to give us advice, and prophets to declare God’s word. Come on! Let’s bring charges against him and get rid of him! Then we will not need to pay attention to anything he says.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 19
<span class=verse-first>19</span>Then I said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Lᴏʀᴅ, pay attention to me.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Listen to what my enemies are saying.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Should good be paid back with evil?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yet they are virtually digging a pit to kill me.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Just remember how I stood before you
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Pleading on their behalf
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To keep you from venting your anger on them.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So let their children die of starvation.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let them be cut down by the sword.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let their wives lose their husbands and children.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let the older men die of disease
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the younger men die by the sword in battle.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let cries of terror be heard in their houses
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When you send bands of raiders unexpectedly to plunder them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For they have virtually dug a pit to capture me
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And have hidden traps for me to step into.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But you, Lᴏʀᴅ, know
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All their plots to kill me.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not pardon their crimes!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not ignore their sins as though you had erased them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let them be brought down in defeat before you.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Deal with them while you are still angry!
