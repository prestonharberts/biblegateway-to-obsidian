## Judgment Against Ammon
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ spoke about the Ammonites:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do you think there are not any people of the nation of Israel remaining?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do you think there are not any of them remaining to reinherit their land?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is that why you people who worship the god Milcom
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Have taken possession of the territory of Gad and live in his cities?
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because you did that,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm that a time is coming
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When I will make Rabbah, the capital city of Ammon,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Hear the sound of the battle cry.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will become a mound covered with ruins.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Its villages will be burned to the ground.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then Israel will take back its land
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>From those who took their land from them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm it!
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Wail, you people in Heshbon, because Ai in Ammon is destroyed.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Cry out in anguish, you people in the villages surrounding Rabbah.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Put on sackcloth and cry out in mourning.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Run about covered with gashes.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For your god Milcom will go into exile
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Along with his priests and officials.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why do you brag about your great power?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your power is ebbing away, you rebellious people of Ammon,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who trust in your riches and say,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Who would dare to attack us?’
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will bring terror on you from every side,”
>Says the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will be scattered in every direction.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No one will gather the fugitives back together.
###### 6

## Judgment Against Edom

<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is wisdom no longer to be found in Teman?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Can Edom’s counselors not give her any good advice?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Has all their wisdom turned bad?
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Turn and flee! Take up refuge in remote places,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You people who live in Dedan.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I will bring disaster on the descendants of Esau.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have decided it is time for me to punish them.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If grape pickers came to pick your grapes,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Would they not leave a few grapes behind?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If robbers came at night,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Would they not pillage only what they needed?
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But I will strip everything away from Esau’s descendants.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will uncover their hiding places so they cannot hide.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their children, relatives, and neighbors will all be destroyed.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Not one of them will be left!
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Leave your orphans behind and I will keep them alive.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your widows, too, can depend on me.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 12
<span class=verse-first>12</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ says, “If even those who did not deserve to drink from the cup of my wrath must drink from it, do you think you will go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, but must certainly drink from the cup of my wrath.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>“For I solemnly swear,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ, “that Bozrah will become a pile of ruins. It will become an object of horror and ridicule, an example to be used in curses. All the towns around it will lie in ruins forever.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14

><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Gather your armies and march out against her!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Prepare to do battle with her!’”
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ says to Edom,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will certainly make you small among nations.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will make you despised by all humankind.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The terror you inspire in others
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the arrogance of your heart have deceived you.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You may make your home in the clefts of the rocks;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You may occupy the highest places in the hills.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But even if you made your home where the eagles nest,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I would bring you down from there,”
>Says the Lᴏʀᴅ.

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All who pass by it will be filled with horror;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will hiss out their scorn
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because of all the disasters that have happened to it.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Edom will be destroyed like Sodom and Gomorrah
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the towns that were around them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No one will live there.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No human being will settle in it,”
>Says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A lion coming up from the thick undergrowth along the Jordan
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Scatters the sheep in the pastureland around it.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So too I will chase the Edomites off their land.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then I will appoint over it whomever I choose.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For there is no one like me, and there is no one who can call me to account.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There is no ruler who can stand up against me.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 20
><span class=verse-first-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So listen to what I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, have planned against Edom,

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their little ones will be dragged off.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will completely destroy their land because of what they have done.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The people of the earth will quake when they hear of their downfall.

###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look! Like an eagle with outspread wings,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A nation will soar up and swoop down on Bozrah.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>At that time the soldiers of Edom will be as fearful
