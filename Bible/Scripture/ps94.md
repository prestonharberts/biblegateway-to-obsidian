###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ, the God who avenges!
>O God who avenges, reveal your splendor.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Rise up, O judge of the earth.
>Pay back the proud.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ, how long will the wicked,
>How long will the wicked celebrate?
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>They spew out threats and speak defiantly;
>All the evildoers boast.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ, they crush your people;
>They oppress the nation that belongs to you.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>They kill the widow and the resident foreigner,
>And they murder the fatherless.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Then they say, “The Lᴏʀᴅ does not see this;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The God of Jacob does not take notice of it.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span>Take notice of this, you ignorant people.
>You fools, when will you ever understand?
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>Does the one who makes the human ear not hear?
>Does the one who forms the human eye not see?
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Does the one who disciplines the nations not punish?
>He is the one who imparts knowledge to human beings!
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ knows that peoples’ thoughts
>Are morally bankrupt.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 12
><span class=verse-first-poetry>12</span>How blessed is the one whom you instruct, O Lᴏʀᴅ,
>The one whom you teach from your law,
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>In order to protect him from times of trouble,
>Until the wicked are destroyed.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>Certainly the Lᴏʀᴅ does not forsake his people;
>He does not abandon the nation that belongs to him.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>For justice will prevail,
>And all the morally upright will be vindicated.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>Who will rise up to defend me against the wicked?
>Who will stand up for me against the evildoers?
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
><span class=verse-first-poetry>17</span>If the Lᴏʀᴅ had not helped me,
>I would soon have dwelt in the silence of death.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>If I say, “My foot is slipping,”
>Your loyal love, O Lᴏʀᴅ, supports me.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>When worries threaten to overwhelm me,
>Your soothing touch makes me happy.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>Cruel rulers are not your allies,
>Those who make oppressive laws.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>They conspire against the blameless,
>And condemn to death the innocent.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>But the Lᴏʀᴅ will protect me,
>And my God will shelter me.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span>He will pay them back for their sin.
>He will destroy them because of their evil;
>The Lᴏʀᴅ our God will destroy them.
