## The Song of Triumph
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the Lᴏʀᴅ. They said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will sing to the Lᴏʀᴅ, for he has triumphed gloriously,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The horse and its rider he has thrown into the sea.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ is my strength and my song,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And he has become my salvation.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>This is my God, and I will praise him,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My father’s God, and I will exalt him.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ is a warrior—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ is his name.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The chariots of Pharaoh and his army he has thrown into the sea,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And his chosen officers were drowned in the Red Sea.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The depths have covered them;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They went down to the bottom like a stone.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your right hand, O Lᴏʀᴅ, was majestic in power;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your right hand, O Lᴏʀᴅ, shattered the enemy.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In the abundance of your majesty you have overthrown
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those who rise up against you.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You sent forth your wrath;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It consumed them like stubble.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>By the blast of your nostrils the waters were piled up,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The flowing water stood upright like a heap,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the deep waters were solidified in the heart of the sea.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The enemy said, ‘I will chase, I will overtake,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will divide the spoil;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>My desire will be satisfied on them.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will draw my sword, my hand will destroy them.’
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But you blew with your breath, and the sea covered them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who is like you, O Lᴏʀᴅ, among the gods?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who is like you—majestic in holiness, fearful in praises, working wonders?
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You stretched out your right hand,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The earth swallowed them.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>By your loyal love you will lead the people whom you have redeemed;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will guide them by your strength to your holy dwelling place.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The nations will hear and tremble;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Anguish will seize the inhabitants of Philistia.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then the chiefs of Edom will be terrified,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Trembling will seize the leaders of Moab,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the inhabitants of Canaan will shake.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Fear and dread will fall on them;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>By the greatness of your arm they will be as still as stone
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Until your people pass by, O Lᴏʀᴅ,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Until the people whom you have bought pass by.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will bring them in and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In the place you made for your residence, O Lᴏʀᴅ,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The sanctuary, O Lord, that your hands have established.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ will reign forever and ever!

###### 19
><span class=verse-first-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the horses of Pharaoh came with his chariots and his footmen into the sea,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the Lᴏʀᴅ brought back the waters of the sea on them,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But the Israelites walked on dry land in the middle of the sea.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 20
<span class=verse-first>20</span>Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a hand drum in her hand, and all the women went out after her with hand drums and with dances.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>Miriam sang in response to them,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Sing to the Lᴏʀᴅ, for he has triumphed gloriously;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The horse and its rider he has thrown into the sea.”
## The Bitter Water
###### 22
<span class=verse-first>22</span>Then Moses led Israel to journey away from the Red Sea. They went out to the wilderness of Shur, walked for three days into the wilderness, and found no water.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>Then they came to Marah, but they were not able to drink the waters of Marah, because they were bitter. (That is why its name was Marah.)
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>So the people murmured against Moses, saying, “What can we drink?”
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>He cried out to the Lᴏʀᴅ, and the Lᴏʀᴅ showed him a tree. When Moses threw it into the water, the water became safe to drink. There the Lᴏʀᴅ made for them a binding ordinance, and there he tested them.
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>He said, “If you will diligently obey the Lᴏʀᴅ your God, and do what is right in his sight, and pay attention to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, then all the diseases that I brought on the Egyptians I will not bring on you, for I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, am your healer.”

###### 27
<span class=verse-first>27</span>Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve wells of water and seventy palm trees, and they camped there by the water.
