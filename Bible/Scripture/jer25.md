## Seventy Years of Servitude for Failure to Give Heed
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>In the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah, the Lᴏʀᴅ spoke to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah. (That was the same as the first year that Nebuchadnezzar was king of Babylon.)
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>So the prophet Jeremiah spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the people who were living in Jerusalem.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“For the last twenty-three years, from the thirteenth year that Josiah son of Amon was ruling in Judah until now, the Lord’s messages have come to me and I have told them to you over and over again. But you would not listen.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“Over and over again the Lᴏʀᴅ has sent his servants the prophets to you. But you have not listened or paid attention.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“He said through them, ‘Each of you must turn from your wicked ways and stop doing the evil things you are doing. If you do, I will allow you to continue to live here in the land that I gave to you and your ancestors as a lasting possession.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>‘Do not pay allegiance to other gods and worship and serve them. Do not make me angry by the things that you do. Then I will not cause you any harm.’
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“So, now the Lᴏʀᴅ says, ‘You have not listened to me. But you have made me angry by the things that you have done. Thus you have brought harm on yourselves.’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>“Therefore, the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies says, ‘You have not listened to what I said.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>‘So I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm that I will send for all the peoples of the north and my servant, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. I will bring them against this land and its inhabitants and all the nations that surround it. I will utterly destroy the land, its inhabitants, and all the surrounding nations and make them everlasting ruins. I will make them objects of horror and hissing scorn.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>‘I will put an end to the sounds of joy and gladness and the glad celebration of brides and grooms in these lands. I will put an end to the sound of people grinding meal. I will put an end to lamps shining in their houses.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>‘This whole area will become a desolate wasteland. These nations will be subject to the king of Babylon for seventy years.’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 12
<span class=verse-first>12</span>“‘But when the seventy years are over, I will punish the king of Babylon and his nation for their sins. I will make the land of Babylon an everlasting ruin. I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm it!
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>‘I will bring on that land everything that I said I would. I will bring on it everything that is written in this book. I will bring on it everything that Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>‘For many nations and great kings will make slaves of the king of Babylon and his nation too. I will repay them for all they have done.’”
## Judah and the Nations Will Experience God’s Wrath
###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>So the Lᴏʀᴅ, the God of Israel, spoke to me in a vision: “Take this cup from my hand. It is filled with the wine of my wrath. Take it and make the nations to whom I send you drink it.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>“When they have drunk it, they will stagger to and fro and act insane. For I will send wars sweeping through them.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
<span class=verse-first>17</span>So I took the cup from the Lᴏʀᴅ’s hand. I made all the nations to whom he sent me drink the wine of his wrath.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>I made Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, its kings and its officials drink it. I did it so Judah would become a ruin. I did it so Judah, its kings, and its officials would become an object of horror and of hissing scorn, an example used in curses. Such is already becoming the case!
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>I made all these other people drink it: Pharaoh, king of Egypt; his attendants, his officials, his people,
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>the foreigners living in Egypt; all the kings of the land of Uz; all the kings of the land of the Philistines, the people of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, the people who had been left alive from Ashdod;
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>all the people of Edom, Moab, Ammon;
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon; all the kings of the coastlands along the sea;
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>the people of Dedan, Tema, Buz, all the desert people who cut their hair short at the temples;
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>all the kings of Arabia who live in the desert;
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>all the kings of Zimri; all the kings of Elam; all the kings of Media;
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>all the kings of the north, whether near or far from one another; and all the other kingdoms that are on the face of the earth. After all of them have drunk the wine of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s wrath, the king of Babylon must drink it.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 27
<span class=verse-first>27</span>Then the Lᴏʀᴅ said to me, “Tell them that the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says, ‘Drink this cup until you get drunk and vomit. Drink until you fall down and can’t get up. For I will send wars sweeping through you.’
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>“If they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink it, tell them that the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies says, ‘You most certainly must drink it!
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>‘For take note, I am already beginning to bring disaster on the city that I call my own. So how can you possibly avoid being punished? You will not go unpunished. For I am proclaiming war against all who live on the earth. I, the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies, affirm it!’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 30
<span class=verse-first>30</span>“Then, Jeremiah, make the following prophecy against them:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Like a lion about to attack, the Lᴏʀᴅ will roar from the heights of heaven;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>From his holy dwelling on high he will roar loudly.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He will roar mightily against his land.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He will shout in triumph, like those stomping juice from the grapes,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Against all those who live on the earth.
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The sounds of battle will resound to the ends of the earth.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ will bring charges against the nations.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He will pass judgment on all humankind
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And will hand the wicked over to be killed in war.’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ so affirms it!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 32
><span class=verse-first-poetry>32</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies says,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Disaster will soon come on one nation after another.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>A mighty storm of military destruction is rising up
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>From the distant parts of the earth.’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 33
><span class=verse-first-poetry>33</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those who have been killed by the Lᴏʀᴅ at that time
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will be scattered from one end of the earth to the other.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will not be mourned over, gathered up, or buried.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their dead bodies will lie scattered over the ground like manure.
###### 34
><span class=verse-body-poetry>34</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Wail and cry out in anguish, you rulers!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Roll in the dust, you who shepherd flocks of people!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The time for you to be slaughtered has come.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will lie scattered and fallen like broken pieces of fine pottery.
###### 35
><span class=verse-body-poetry>35</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The leaders will not be able to run away and hide.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The shepherds of the flocks will not be able to escape.
###### 36
><span class=verse-body-poetry>36</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Listen to the cries of anguish of the leaders.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Listen to the wails of the shepherds of the flocks.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are wailing because the Lᴏʀᴅ
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is about to destroy their lands.
###### 37
><span class=verse-body-poetry>37</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their peaceful dwelling places will be laid waste
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>By the fierce anger of the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 38
><span class=verse-body-poetry>38</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ is like a lion who has left his lair.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So their lands will certainly be laid waste
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>By the warfare of the oppressive nation
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And by the fierce anger of the Lᴏʀᴅ.”
