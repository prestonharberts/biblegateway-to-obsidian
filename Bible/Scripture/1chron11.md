## David Becomes King
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>All Israel joined David at Hebron and said, “Look, we are your very flesh and blood!
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“In the past, even when Saul was king, you were Israel’s commanding general. The Lᴏʀᴅ your God said to you, ‘You will shepherd my people Israel; you will rule over my people Israel.’”
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>When all the leaders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the Lᴏʀᴅ. They anointed David king over Israel, in keeping with the Lord’s message that came through Samuel.
## David Conquers Jerusalem
###### 4
<span class=verse-first>4</span>David and the whole Israelite army advanced to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus). (The Jebusites, the land’s original inhabitants, lived there.)
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>The residents of Jebus said to David, “You cannot invade this place!” But David captured the fortress of Zion (that is, the City of David).
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>David said, “Whoever attacks the Jebusites first will become commanding general!” So Joab son of Zeruiah attacked first and became commander.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>David lived in the fortress; for this reason it is called the City of David.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>He built up the city around it, from the terrace to the surrounding walls; Joab restored the rest of the city.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>David’s power steadily grew, for the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies was with him.
## David’s Warriors
###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>These were the leaders of David’s warriors who, together with all Israel, stood courageously with him in his kingdom by installing him as king, in keeping with the Lᴏʀᴅ’s message concerning Israel.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>This is the list of David’s warriors:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

Jashobeam, a Hacmonite, was head of the officers. He killed 300 men with his spear in a single battle.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 12
<span class=verse-first>12</span>Next in command was Eleazar son of Dodo the Ahohite. He was one of the three elite warriors.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>He was with David in Pas Dammim when the Philistines assembled there for battle. In an area of the field that was full of barley, the army retreated before the Philistines,
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>but then they made a stand in the middle of that area. They defended it and defeated the Philistines; the Lᴏʀᴅ gave them a great victory.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>Three of the thirty leaders went down to David at the rocky cliff at the cave of Adullam, while a Philistine force was camped in the Valley of Rephaim.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>David was in the stronghold at the time, while a Philistine garrison was in Bethlehem.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>David was thirsty and said, “How I wish someone would give me some water to drink from the cistern in Bethlehem near the city gate!”
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>So the three elite warriors broke through the Philistine forces and drew some water from the cistern in Bethlehem near the city gate. They carried it back to David, but David refused to drink it. He poured it out as a drink offering to the Lᴏʀᴅ
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>and said, “God forbid that I should do this! Should I drink the blood of these men who risked their lives?” Because they risked their lives to bring it to him, he refused to drink it. Such were the exploits of the three elite warriors.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 20
<span class=verse-first>20</span>Abishai the brother of Joab was head of the three elite warriors. He killed 300 men with his spear and gained fame along with the three elite warriors.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>From the three he was given double honor and he became their officer, even though he was not one of them.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 22
<span class=verse-first>22</span>Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a brave warrior from Kabzeel who performed great exploits. He struck down the two sons of Ariel of Moab; he also went down and killed a lion inside a cistern on a snowy day.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>He even killed an Egyptian who was 7½ feet tall. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand as big as the crossbeam of a weaver’s loom; Benaiah attacked him with a club. He grabbed the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada, who gained fame along with the three elite warriors.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>He received honor from the thirty warriors, though he was not one of the three elite warriors. David put him in charge of his bodyguard.
