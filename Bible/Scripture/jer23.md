## New Leaders over a Regathered Remnant
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ says, “The leaders of my people are sure to be judged. They were supposed to watch over my people like shepherds watch over their sheep. But they are causing my people to be destroyed and scattered.”
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>So the Lᴏʀᴅ God of Israel has this to say about the leaders who are ruling over his people: “You have caused my people to be dispersed and driven into exile. You have not taken care of them. So I will punish you for the evil that you have done. I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm it!
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“Then I myself will regather those of my people who are still alive from all the countries where I have driven them. I will bring them back to their homeland. They will greatly increase in number.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“I will install rulers over them who will care for them. Then they will no longer need to fear or be terrified. None of them will turn up missing. I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, promise it!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 5
><span class=verse-first-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, promise that a new time will certainly come
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When I will raise up for them a righteous branch, a descendant of David.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will rule over them with wisdom and understanding
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And will do what is just and right in the land.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Under his rule Judah will enjoy safety
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And Israel will live in security.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>This is the name he will go by:
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ has provided us with justice.’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
<span class=verse-first>7</span>“So I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, say: ‘A new time will certainly come. People now affirm their oaths with, “I swear as surely as the Lᴏʀᴅ lives who delivered the people of Israel out of Egypt.”
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>‘But at that time they will affirm them with, “I swear as surely as the Lᴏʀᴅ lives who delivered the descendants of the former nation of Israel from the land of the north and from all the other lands where he had banished them.” At that time they will live in their own land.’”
## Oracles Against the False Prophets
###### 9
<span class=verse-first>9</span>Here is what the Lᴏʀᴅ says concerning the false prophets:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

>My heart and my mind are deeply disturbed.
>I tremble all over.
>I am like a drunk person,
>Like a person who has had too much wine,
>Because of the way the Lᴏʀᴅ
>And his holy word are being mistreated.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>For the land is full of people unfaithful to him.
>They live wicked lives and they misuse their power.
>So the land is dried up because it is under his curse.
>The pastures in the wilderness are withered.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>Moreover, the Lᴏʀᴅ says,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Both the prophets and priests are godless.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have even found them doing evil in my temple.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So the paths they follow will be dark and slippery.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will stumble and fall headlong.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I will bring disaster on them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A day of reckoning is coming for them.”
>The Lᴏʀᴅ affirms it!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ says, “I saw the prophets of Samaria
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Doing something that was disgusting.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They prophesied in the name of the god Baal
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And led my people Israel astray.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But I see the prophets of Jerusalem
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Doing something just as shocking.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are unfaithful to me
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And continually prophesy lies.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So they give encouragement to people who are doing evil,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>With the result that they do not stop their evildoing.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I consider all of them as bad as the people of Sodom,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the citizens of Jerusalem as bad as the people of Gomorrah.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So then I, the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Have something to say concerning the prophets of Jerusalem:
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will make these prophets eat the bitter food of suffering
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And drink the poison water of judgment.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For the prophets of Jerusalem are the reason
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>That ungodliness has spread throughout the land.’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 16
<span class=verse-first>16</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies says to the people of Jerusalem:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not listen to what
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those prophets are saying to you.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are filling you with false hopes.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are reporting visions of their own imaginations,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Not something the Lᴏʀᴅ has given them to say.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They continually say to those who reject what the Lᴏʀᴅ has said,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Things will go well for you!’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They say to all those who follow the stubborn inclinations of their own hearts,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Nothing bad will happen to you!’
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yet which of them has ever stood in the Lᴏʀᴅ’s inner circle
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So they could see and hear what he has to say?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Which of them have ever paid attention or listened to what he has said?
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But just watch! The wrath of the Lᴏʀᴅ
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will come like a storm!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a raging storm it will rage down
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>On the heads of those who are wicked.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The anger of the Lᴏʀᴅ will not turn back
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Until he has fully carried out his intended purposes.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In future days
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You people will come to understand this clearly.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I did not send those prophets,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yet they were in a hurry to give their message.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I did not tell them anything,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yet they prophesied anyway.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But if they had stood in my inner circle,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They would have proclaimed my message to my people.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They would have caused my people to turn from their wicked ways
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And stop doing the evil things they are doing.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 23
><span class=verse-first-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do you people think that I am some local deity
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And not the transcendent God?” the Lᴏʀᴅ asks.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do you really think anyone can hide himself
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Where I cannot see him?” the Lᴏʀᴅ asks.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do you not know that I am everywhere?”
>The Lᴏʀᴅ asks.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 25
<span class=verse-first>25</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ says, “I have heard what those prophets who are prophesying lies in my name are saying. They are saying, ‘I have had a dream! I have had a dream!’
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>“Those prophets are just prophesying lies. They are prophesying the delusions of their own minds.
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>“How long will they go on plotting to make my people forget who I am through the dreams they tell one another? That is just as bad as what their ancestors did when they forgot who I am by worshiping the god Baal.
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>“Let the prophet who has had a dream go ahead and tell his dream. Let the person who has received my message report that message faithfully. What is like straw cannot compare to what is like grain! I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm it!
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>“My message is like a fire that purges dross. It is like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces. I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, so affirm it!
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>“So I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm that I am opposed to those prophets who steal messages from one another that they claim are from me.
###### 31
<span class=verse-body>31</span>“I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm that I am opposed to those prophets who are using their own tongues to declare, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ declares.’
###### 32
<span class=verse-body>32</span>“I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm that I am opposed to those prophets who dream up lies and report them. They are misleading my people with their reckless lies. I did not send them. I did not commission them. They are not helping these people at all. I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm it!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 33
<span class=verse-first>33</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said to me, “Jeremiah, when one of these people, or a prophet, or a priest asks you, ‘What burdensome message do you have from the Lᴏʀᴅ?’ Tell them, ‘You are the burden, and I will cast you away. I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, affirm it!
###### 34
<span class=verse-body>34</span>“I will punish any prophet, priest, or other person who says “The Lᴏʀᴅ’s message is burdensome.” I will punish both that person and his whole family.’”
###### 35
<span class=verse-body>35</span>So I, Jeremiah, tell you, “Each of you people should say to his friend or his relative, ‘How did the Lᴏʀᴅ answer? Or what did the Lᴏʀᴅ say?’
###### 36
<span class=verse-body>36</span>“You must no longer say that the Lᴏʀᴅ’s message is burdensome. For what is ‘burdensome’ really pertains to what a person himself says. You are misrepresenting the words of our God, the living God, the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies.
###### 37
<span class=verse-body>37</span>“Each of you should merely ask the prophet, ‘What answer did the Lᴏʀᴅ give you? Or what did the Lᴏʀᴅ say?’
###### 38
<span class=verse-body>38</span>“But just suppose you continue to say, ‘The message of the Lᴏʀᴅ is burdensome.’ Here is what the Lᴏʀᴅ says will happen: ‘I sent word to you that you must not say, “The Lᴏʀᴅ’s message is burdensome.” But you used the words, “The Lᴏʀᴅ’s message is burdensome,” anyway.
###### 39
<span class=verse-body>39</span>‘So I will carry you far off and throw you away. I will send both you and the city I gave to you and to your ancestors out of my sight.
###### 40
<span class=verse-body>40</span>I will bring on you lasting shame and lasting disgrace that will never be forgotten!’”
