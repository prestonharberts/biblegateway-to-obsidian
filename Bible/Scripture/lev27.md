## Redemption of Persons Given as Votive Offerings
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ spoke to Moses:
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“Speak to the Israelites and tell them, ‘When a man makes a special votive offering based on the conversion value of a person to the Lᴏʀᴅ,
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>‘the conversion value of the male from twenty years old up to sixty years old is fifty shekels by the standard of the sanctuary shekel.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>‘If the person is a female, the conversion value is thirty shekels.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>‘If the person is from five years old up to twenty years old, the conversion value of the male is twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>‘If the person is one month old up to five years old, the conversion value of the male is five shekels of silver, and for the female the conversion value is three shekels of silver.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>‘If the person is from sixty years old and older, if he is a male the conversion value is fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>‘If the person making the votive offering is too poor to pay the conversion value, he must stand the person before the priest and the priest will establish his conversion value; according to what the man who made the votive offering can afford, the priest will establish his conversion value.’
## Redemption of Animals Given as Votive Offerings
###### 9
<span class=verse-first>9</span>“‘If what is vowed is a kind of animal from which an offering may be presented to the Lᴏʀᴅ, anything which he gives to the Lᴏʀᴅ from this kind of animal will be holy.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>‘He must not replace or exchange it, good for bad or bad for good, and if he does indeed exchange one animal for another animal, then both the original animal and its substitute will be holy.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>‘If what is vowed is an unclean animal from which an offering must not be presented to the Lᴏʀᴅ, then he must stand the animal before the priest,
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>‘and the priest will establish its conversion value, whether good or bad. According to the conversion value assessed by the priest, thus it will be.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>‘If, however, the person who made the vow redeems the animal, he must add one-fifth to its conversion value.’
## Redemption of Houses Given as Votive Offerings
###### 14
<span class=verse-first>14</span>“‘If a man consecrates his house as holy to the Lᴏʀᴅ, the priest will establish its conversion value, whether good or bad. Just as the priest establishes its conversion value, thus it will stand.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>‘If the one who consecrates it redeems his house, he must add to it one-fifth of its conversion value in silver, and it will belong to him.’
## Redemption of Fields Given as Votive Offerings
###### 16
<span class=verse-first>16</span>“‘If a man consecrates to the Lᴏʀᴅ some of his own landed property, the conversion value must be calculated in accordance with the amount of seed needed to sow it, a homer of barley seed being priced at fifty shekels of silver.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>‘If he consecrates his field in the Jubilee year, the conversion value will stand,
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>‘but if he consecrates his field after the Jubilee, the priest will calculate the price for him according to the years that are left until the next Jubilee year, and it will be deducted from the conversion value.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>‘If, however, the one who consecrated the field redeems it, he must add to it one-fifth of the conversion price and it will belong to him.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>‘If he does not redeem the field, but sells the field to someone else, he may never redeem it.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>‘When it reverts in the Jubilee, the field will be holy to the Lᴏʀᴅ like a permanently dedicated field; it will become the priest’s property.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>“‘If he consecrates to the Lᴏʀᴅ a field he has purchased, which is not part of his own landed property,
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>‘the priest will calculate for him the amount of its conversion value until the Jubilee year, and he must pay the conversion value on that Jubilee day as something that is holy to the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>‘In the Jubilee year the field will return to the one from whom he bought it, the one to whom it belongs as landed property.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>‘Every conversion value must be calculated by the standard of the sanctuary shekel; twenty gerahs to the shekel.’
## Redemption of the Firstborn
###### 26
<span class=verse-first>26</span>“‘Surely no man may consecrate a firstborn that already belongs to the Lᴏʀᴅ as a firstborn among the animals; whether it is an ox or a sheep, it belongs to the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>‘If, however, it is among the unclean animals, he may ransom it according to its conversion value and must add one-fifth to it, but if it is not redeemed it must be sold according to its conversion value.’
## Things Permanently Dedicated to the Lord
###### 28
<span class=verse-first>28</span>“‘Surely anything that a man permanently dedicates to the Lᴏʀᴅ from all that belongs to him, whether from people, animals, or his landed property, must be neither sold nor redeemed; anything permanently dedicated is most holy to the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>‘Any human being who is permanently dedicated to the Lᴏʀᴅ must not be ransomed; such a person must be put to death.’
## Redemption of the Tithe
###### 30
<span class=verse-first>30</span>“‘Any tithe of the land, from the grain of the land or from the fruit of the trees, belongs to the Lᴏʀᴅ; it is holy to the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 31
<span class=verse-body>31</span>‘If a man redeems part of his tithe, however, he must add one-fifth to it.
###### 32
<span class=verse-body>32</span>‘All the tithe of herds or flocks, everything which passes under the rod, the tenth one will be holy to the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 33
<span class=verse-body>33</span>‘The owner must not examine the animals to distinguish between good and bad, and he must not exchange it. If, however, he does exchange it, both the original animal and its substitute will be holy and must not be redeemed.’”
## Final Colophon
###### 34
<span class=verse-first>34</span>These are the commandments which the Lᴏʀᴅ commanded Moses to tell the Israelites at Mount Sinai.
