## Futility of Self-Indulgent Pleasure
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>I thought to myself,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Come now, I will try self-indulgent pleasure to see if it is worthwhile.”
>But I found that it also is futile.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>I said of partying, “It is folly,”
>And of self-indulgent pleasure, “It accomplishes nothing!”
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>I thought deeply about the effects of indulging myself with wine
>(all the while my mind was guiding me with wisdom)
>And the effects of behaving foolishly,
>So that I might discover what is profitable
>For people to do on earth during the few days of their lives.
## Futility of Materialism
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>I increased my possessions:
>I built houses for myself;
>I planted vineyards for myself.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>I designed royal gardens and parks for myself,
>And I planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>I constructed pools of water for myself,
>To irrigate my grove of flourishing trees.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>I purchased male and female slaves,
>And I owned slaves who were born in my house;
>I also possessed more livestock—both herds and flocks—
>Than any of my predecessors in Jerusalem.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>I also amassed silver and gold for myself,
>As well as valuable treasures taken from kingdoms and provinces.
>I acquired male singers and female singers for myself,
>And what gives a man sensual delight—a harem of beautiful concubines.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span>So I was far wealthier than all my predecessors in Jerusalem,
>Yet I maintained my objectivity.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>I did not restrain myself from getting whatever I wanted;
>I did not deny myself anything that would bring me pleasure.
>So all my accomplishments gave me joy;
>This was my reward for all my effort.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Yet when I reflected on everything I had accomplished
>And on all the effort that I had expended to accomplish it,
>I concluded: “All these achievements and possessions are ultimately profitless—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like chasing the wind!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There is nothing gained from them on earth.”
## Wisdom is Better than Folly
###### 12
><span class=verse-first-poetry>12</span>Next, I decided to consider wisdom, as well as foolish behavior and ideas.
>For what more can the king’s successor do than what the king has already done?
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>I realized that wisdom is preferable to folly,
>Just as light is preferable to darkness:
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>The wise man can see where he is going, but the fool walks in darkness.
>Yet I also realized that the same fate happens to them both.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>So I thought to myself, “The fate of the fool will happen even to me!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then what did I gain by becoming so excessively wise?”
>So I lamented to myself,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The benefits of wisdom are ultimately meaningless!”
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>For the wise man, like the fool, will not be remembered for very long,
>Because in the days to come, both will already have been forgotten.
>Alas, the wise man dies—just like the fool!
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>So I loathed life because what
>Happens on earth seems awful to me;
>For all the benefits of wisdom are futile—like chasing the wind.
## Futility of Being a Workaholic
###### 18
><span class=verse-first-poetry>18</span>So I loathed all the fruit of my effort,
>For which I worked so hard on earth,
>Because I must leave it behind in the hands of my successor.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>Who knows if he will be a wise man or a fool?
>Yet he will be master over all the fruit of my labor
>For which I worked so wisely on earth.
>This also is futile!
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>So I began to despair about all the fruit of my labor
>For which I worked so hard on earth.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>For a man may do his work with wisdom, knowledge, and skill;
>However, he must hand over the fruit of his labor as an inheritance
>To someone else who did not work for it.
>This also is futile, and an awful injustice!
## Painful Days and Restless Nights
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>What does a man acquire from all his labor
>And from the anxiety that accompanies his toil on earth?
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span>For all day long his work produces pain and frustration,
>And even at night his mind cannot relax.
>This also is futile!
## Enjoy Work and its Benefits
###### 24
><span class=verse-first-poetry>24</span>There is nothing better for people than to eat and drink,
>And to find enjoyment in their work.
>I also perceived that this ability to find enjoyment comes from God.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span>For no one can eat and drink
>Or experience joy apart from him.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span>For to the one who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy,
>But to the sinner, he gives the task of amassing wealth—
>Only to give it to the one who pleases God.
>This task of the wicked is futile—like chasing the wind!
