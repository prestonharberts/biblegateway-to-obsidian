###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“Speak to the Israelites and tell them, ‘When you enter the land that I am giving you, the land must observe a Sabbath to the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>‘Six years you may sow your field, and six years you may prune your vineyard and gather the produce,
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>‘but in the seventh year the land must have a Sabbath of complete rest—a Sabbath to the Lᴏʀᴅ. You must not sow your field or prune your vineyard.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>‘You must not gather in the aftergrowth of your harvest and you must not pick the grapes of your unpruned vines; the land must have a year of complete rest.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>‘You may have the Sabbath produce of the land to eat—you, your male servant, your female servant, your hired worker, the resident foreigner who stays with you,
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>‘your cattle, and the wild animals that are in your land—all its produce will be for you to eat.

<span class=verse-first>8</span>“‘You must count off seven weeks of years, seven times seven years, and the days of the seven weeks of years will amount to forty-nine years.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>‘You must sound loud horn blasts—in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, on the Day of Atonement—you must sound the horn in your entire land.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>‘So you must consecrate the fiftieth year, and you must proclaim a release in the land for all its inhabitants. That year will be your Jubilee; each one of you must return to his property and each one of you must return to his clan.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>‘That fiftieth year will be your Jubilee; you must not sow the land, harvest its aftergrowth, or pick the grapes of its unpruned vines.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>‘Because that year is a Jubilee, it will be holy to you—you may eat its produce from the field.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>“‘In this Year of Jubilee you must each return to your property.

###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>‘You may buy it from your fellow citizen according to the number of years since the last Jubilee; he may sell it to you according to the years of produce that are left.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>‘The more years there are, the more you may make its purchase price, and the fewer years there are, the less you must make its purchase price, because he is only selling to you a number of years of produce.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>‘No one is to oppress his fellow citizen, but you must fear your God, because I am the Lᴏʀᴅ your God.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span>‘You must obey my statutes and my regulations; you must be sure to keep them so that you may live securely in the land.

<span class=verse-body>19</span>“‘The land will give its fruit and you may eat until you are satisfied, and you may live securely in the land.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>‘If you say, “What will we eat in the seventh year if we do not sow and gather our produce?”
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>‘I will command my blessing for you in the sixth year so that it may yield the produce for three years,
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>‘and you may sow the eighth year and eat from that sixth year’s produce—old produce. Until you bring in the ninth year’s produce, you may eat old produce.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 23
<span class=verse-first>23</span>‘The land must not be sold without reclaim because the land belongs to me, for you are foreign residents, temporary settlers, with me.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>‘In all your landed property you must provide for the right of redemption of the land.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 25
<span class=verse-first>25</span>“‘If your brother becomes impoverished and sells some of his property, his near redeemer is to come to you and redeem what his brother sold.
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>‘If a man has no redeemer, but he prospers and gains enough for its redemption,
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>‘he is to calculate the value of the years it was sold, refund the balance to the man to whom he had sold it, and return to his property.
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>‘If he has not prospered enough to refund a balance to him, then what he sold will belong to the one who bought it until the Jubilee year, but it must revert in the Jubilee and the original owner may return to his property.

‘## Release of Houses
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 29
<span class=verse-first>29</span>“‘If a man sells a residential house in a walled city, its right of redemption must extend until one full year from its sale; its right of redemption must extend to a full calendar year.
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>‘If it is not redeemed before the full calendar year is ended, the house in the walled city will belong without reclaim to the one who bought it throughout his generations; it will not revert in the Jubilee.
###### 31
<span class=verse-body>31</span>‘The houses of villages, however, which have no wall surrounding them must be considered as the field of the land; they will have the right of redemption and must revert in the Jubilee.
###### 32
<span class=verse-body>32</span>‘As for the cities of the Levites, the houses in the cities which they possess, the Levites must have a perpetual right of redemption.
###### 33
<span class=verse-body>33</span>‘Whatever someone among the Levites might redeem—the sale of a house which is his property in a city—must revert in the Jubilee, because the houses of the cities of the Levites are their property in the midst of the Israelites.
###### 34
<span class=verse-body>34</span>‘Moreover, the open field areas of their cities must not be sold, because that is their perpetual possession.

###### 48
<span class=verse-body>48</span>‘after he has sold himself he retains a right of redemption. One of his brothers may redeem him,
