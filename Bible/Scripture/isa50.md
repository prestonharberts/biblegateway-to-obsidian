###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ says:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Where is your mother’s divorce certificate
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>By which I divorced her?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or to which of my creditors did I sell you?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, you were sold because of your sins;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because of your rebellious acts I divorced your mother.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why does no one challenge me when I come?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why does no one respond when I call?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is my hand too weak to deliver you?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do I lack the power to rescue you?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, with a mere shout I can dry up the sea;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I can turn streams into a desert,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So the fish rot away and die
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>From lack of water.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I can clothe the sky in darkness;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I can cover it with sackcloth.”
## The Servant Perseveres
###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span>The Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ has given me the capacity to be his spokesman,
>So that I know how to help the weary.
>He wakes me up every morning;
>He makes me alert so I can listen attentively as disciples do.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>The Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ has spoken to me clearly;
>I have not rebelled,
>I have not turned back.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>I offered my back to those who attacked,
>My jaws to those who tore out my beard;
>I did not hide my face
>From insults and spitting.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>But the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ helps me,
>So I am not humiliated.
>For that reason I am steadfastly resolved;
>I know I will not be put to shame.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>The one who vindicates me is close by.
>Who dares to argue with me? Let us confront each other!
>Who is my accuser? Let him challenge me!
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>Look, the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ helps me.
>Who dares to condemn me?
>Look, all of them will wear out like clothes;
>A moth will eat away at them.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Who among you fears the Lᴏʀᴅ?
>Who obeys his servant?
>Whoever walks in deep darkness,
>Without light,
>Should trust in the name of the Lᴏʀᴅ
>And rely on his God.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Look, all of you who start a fire
>And who equip yourselves with flaming arrows,
>Walk in the light of the fire you started
>And among the flaming arrows you ignited!
>This is what you will receive from me:
>You will lie down in a place of pain.
