###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For wrath kills the foolish person,

###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For evil does not come up from the dust,

###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But people are born to trouble,
