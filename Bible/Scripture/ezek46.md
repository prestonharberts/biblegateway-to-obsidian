## The Prince’s Offerings
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>“‘This is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says: The gate of the inner court that faces east will be closed six working days, but on the Sabbath day it will be opened and on the day of the new moon it will be opened.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>‘The prince will enter by way of the porch of the gate from the outside and will stand by the doorpost of the gate. The priests will provide his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he will bow down at the threshold of the gate and then go out. But the gate will not be closed until evening.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>‘The people of the land will bow down at the entrance of that gate before the Lᴏʀᴅ on the Sabbaths and on the new moons.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>‘The burnt offering that the prince will offer to the Lᴏʀᴅ on the Sabbath day will be six unblemished lambs and one unblemished ram.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>‘The grain offering will be an ephah with the ram, and the grain offering with the lambs will be as much as he is able to give, and a gallon of olive oil with an ephah.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>‘On the day of the new moon he will offer an unblemished young bull and six lambs and a ram, all without blemish.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>‘He will provide a grain offering: an ephah with the bull and an ephah with the ram, and with the lambs as much as he wishes, and a gallon of olive oil with each ephah of grain.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>‘When the prince enters, he will come by way of the porch of the gate and will go out the same way.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>“‘When the people of the land come before the Lᴏʀᴅ at the appointed feasts, whoever enters by way of the north gate to worship will go out by way of the south gate; whoever enters by way of the south gate will go out by way of the north gate. No one will return by way of the gate they entered but will go out straight ahead.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>‘When they come in, the prince will come in with them, and when they go out, he will go out.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>“‘At the festivals and at the appointed feasts the grain offering will be an ephah with the bull and an ephah with the ram, and with the lambs as much as one is able, and a gallon of olive oil with each ephah of grain.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>‘When the prince provides a freewill offering, a burnt offering, or peace offerings as a voluntary offering to the Lᴏʀᴅ, the gate facing east will be opened for him, and he will provide his burnt offering and his peace offerings just as he did on the Sabbath. Then he will go out, and the gate will be closed after he goes out.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>“‘You will provide a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering daily to the Lᴏʀᴅ; morning by morning he will provide it.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>‘And you will provide a grain offering with it morning by morning, a sixth of an ephah, and a third of a gallon of olive oil to moisten the choice flour, as a grain offering to the Lᴏʀᴅ; this is a perpetual statute.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>‘Thus they will provide the lamb, the grain offering, and the olive oil morning by morning, as a perpetual burnt offering.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 16
<span class=verse-first>16</span>“‘This is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says: If the prince should give a gift to one of his sons as his inheritance, it will belong to his sons; it is their property by inheritance.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>‘But if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, it will be his until the year of liberty; then it will revert to the prince. His inheritance will only remain with his sons.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>‘The prince will not take away any of the people’s inheritance by oppressively removing them from their property. He will give his sons an inheritance from his own possessions so that my people will not be scattered, each from his own property.’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 19
<span class=verse-first>19</span>Then he brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which faced north. There I saw a place at the extreme western end.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>He said to me, “This is the place where the priests will boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, and where they will bake the grain offering, so that they do not bring them out to the outer court to transmit holiness to the people.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 21
<span class=verse-first>21</span>Then he brought me out to the outer court and led me past the four corners of the court, and I noticed that in every corner of the court there was a court.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>In the four corners of the court were small courts, 70 feet in length and 52½ feet in width; the four were all the same size.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>There was a row of masonry around each of the four courts, and places for boiling offerings were made under the rows all around.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>Then he said to me, “These are the houses for boiling, where the ministers of the temple boil the sacrifices of the people.”
