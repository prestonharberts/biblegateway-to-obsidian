## A Locust Plague Foreshadows the Day of the Lord
###### 2

>Pay attention, all inhabitants of the land.
>Has anything like this ever happened in your whole life
>Or in the lifetime of your ancestors?
###### 3

###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span>What the gazam-locust left the ‘arbeh-locust consumed,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>What the ‘arbeh-locust left the yeleq-locust consumed,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And what the yeleq-locust left the hasil-locust consumed.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Wake up, you drunkards, and weep!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Wail, all you wine drinkers,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Because the sweet wine has been taken away from you.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For a nation has invaded my land,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Mighty and without number.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Their teeth are lion’s teeth;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They have the fangs of a lioness.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They have destroyed my vines;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They have turned my fig trees into mere splinters.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They have completely stripped off the bark and thrown it aside;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The twigs are stripped bare.’
## A Call to Lament
###### 8
><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Wail like a young virgin clothed in sackcloth,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Lamenting the death of her husband to be.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>No one brings grain offerings or drink offerings
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>To the temple of the Lᴏʀᴅ anymore.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>So the priests, those who serve the Lᴏʀᴅ, are in mourning.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The crops of the fields have been destroyed.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The ground is in mourning because the grain has perished.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The fresh wine has dried up;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The olive oil languishes.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Be distressed, farmers;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Wail, vinedressers, over the wheat and the barley.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For the harvest of the field has perished.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The vine has dried up;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The fig tree languishes—
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The pomegranate, date, and apple as well.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>In fact, all the trees of the field have dried up.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Indeed, the joy of the people has dried up!

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Get dressed and lament, you priests.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Wail, you who minister at the altar.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Come, spend the night in sackcloth, you servants of my God,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Because no one brings grain offerings or drink offerings
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>To the temple of your God anymore.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Announce a holy fast;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Proclaim a sacred assembly.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>To the temple of the Lᴏʀᴅ your God,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And cry out to the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>How awful that day will be!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For the day of the Lᴏʀᴅ is near;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>It will come as destruction from the Divine Destroyer.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Our food has been cut off right before our eyes!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>There is no longer any joy or gladness in the temple of our God.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The grains of seed have shriveled beneath their shovels.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Storehouses have been decimated,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And granaries have been torn down,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Because the grain has dried up.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Listen to the cattle groan!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The herds of livestock wander around in confusion
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Because they have no pasture.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Even the flocks of sheep are suffering.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>To you, O Lᴏʀᴅ, I call out for help,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For fire has burned up the pastures of the wilderness,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Flames have razed all the trees in the fields.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Even the wild animals cry out to you,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For the river beds have dried up;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Fire has destroyed the pastures of the wilderness.’”
