## The Death of Moses
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Then Moses ascended from the rift valley plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the summit of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho. The Lᴏʀᴅ showed him the whole land—Gilead to Dan,
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>and all of Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the distant sea,
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>the Negev, and the plain of the Valley of Jericho, the city of date palm trees, as far as Zoar.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>Then the Lᴏʀᴅ said to him, “This is the land I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob when I said, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ I have let you see it, but you will not cross over there.”
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>So Moses, the servant of the Lᴏʀᴅ, died there in the land of Moab as the Lᴏʀᴅ had said.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab near Beth Peor, but no one knows his exact burial place to this very day.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>Moses was 120 years old when he died, but his eye was not dull nor had his vitality departed.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>The Israelites mourned for Moses in the rift valley plains of Moab for thirty days; then the days of mourning for Moses ended.
## An Epitaph for Moses
###### 9
<span class=verse-first>9</span>Now Joshua son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had placed his hands on him; and the Israelites listened to him and did just what the Lᴏʀᴅ had commanded Moses.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>No prophet ever again arose in Israel like Moses, who knew the Lᴏʀᴅ face to face.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>He did all the signs and wonders the Lᴏʀᴅ had sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, all his servants, and the whole land,
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>and he displayed great power and awesome might in view of all Israel.
