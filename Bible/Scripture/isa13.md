## The Lord Will Judge Babylon
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>This is an oracle about Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz saw:
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>On a bare hill raise a signal flag;
>Shout to them,
>Wave your hand,
>So they might enter the gates of the princes!
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>I have given orders to my chosen soldiers;
>I have summoned the warriors through whom I will vent my anger—
>My boasting, arrogant ones.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>There is a loud noise on the mountains—
>It sounds like a large army!
>There is great commotion among the kingdoms—
>Nations are being assembled!
>The Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies is mustering
>Forces for battle.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>They come from a distant land,
>From the horizon.
>It is the Lᴏʀᴅ with his instruments of judgment,
>Coming to destroy the whole earth.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Wail, for the Lᴏʀᴅ’s day of judgment is near;
>It comes with all the destructive power of the Sovereign One.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>For this reason all hands hang limp,
>Every human heart loses its courage.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>They panic—
>Cramps and pain seize hold of them
>Like those of a woman who is straining to give birth.
>They look at one another in astonishment;
>Their faces are flushed red.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>Look, the Lᴏʀᴅ’s day of judgment is coming;
>It is a day of cruelty and savage, raging anger,
>Destroying the earth
>And annihilating its sinners.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Indeed the stars in the sky and their constellations
>No longer give out their light;
>The sun is darkened as soon as it rises,
>And the moon does not shine.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>I will punish the world for its evil,
>And wicked people for their sin.
>I will put an end to the pride of the insolent,
>I will bring down the arrogance of tyrants.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>I will make human beings more scarce than pure gold,
>And people more scarce than gold from Ophir.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>So I will shake the heavens,
>And the earth will shake loose from its foundation,
>Because of the fury of the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies,
>In the day he vents his raging anger.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>Like a frightened gazelle
>Or a sheep with no shepherd,
>Each will turn toward home,
>Each will run to his homeland.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>Everyone who is caught will be stabbed;
>Everyone who is seized will die by the sword.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>Their children will be smashed to pieces before their very eyes;
>Their houses will be looted
>And their wives raped.

###### 17
><span class=verse-first-poetry>17</span>Look, I am stirring up the Medes to attack them;
>They are not concerned about silver,
>Nor are they interested in gold.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>Their arrows will cut young men to ribbons;
>They have no compassion on a person’s offspring;
>They will not look with pity on children.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>Babylon, the most admired of kingdoms,
>The Chaldeans’ source of honor and pride,
>Will be destroyed by God
>Just as Sodom and Gomorrah were.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>No one will live there again;
>No one will ever reside there again.
>No bedouin will camp there,
>No shepherds will rest their flocks there.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>Wild animals will rest there,
>The ruined houses will be full of hyenas.
>Ostriches will live there,
>Wild goats will skip among the ruins.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>Wild dogs will yip in her ruined fortresses,
>Jackals will yelp in the once-splendid palaces.
>Her time is almost up,
>Her days will not be prolonged.
