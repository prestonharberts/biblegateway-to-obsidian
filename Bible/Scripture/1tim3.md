## Qualifications for Overseers and Deacons
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>This saying is trustworthy: “If someone aspires to the office of overseer, he desires a good work.”
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>The overseer then must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, an able teacher,
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>not a drunkard, not violent, but gentle, not contentious, free from the love of money.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>He must manage his own household well and keep his children in control without losing his dignity.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>But if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for the church of God?
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>He must not be a recent convert or he may become arrogant and fall into the punishment that the devil will exact.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>And he must be well thought of by those outside the faith, so that he may not fall into disgrace and be caught by the devil’s trap.

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>Deacons likewise must be dignified, not two-faced, not given to excessive drinking, not greedy for gain,
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>And these also must be tested first and then let them serve as deacons if they are found blameless.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>Likewise also their wives must be dignified, not slanderous, temperate, faithful in every respect.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>Deacons must be husbands of one wife and good managers of their children and their own households.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>For those who have served well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and great boldness in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
## Conduct in God’s Church
###### 14
<span class=verse-first>14</span>I hope to come to you soon, but I am writing these instructions to you
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>in case I am delayed, to let you know how people ought to conduct themselves in the household of God, because it is the church of the living God, the support and bulwark of the truth.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>And we all agree, our religion contains amazing revelation:

>Vindicated by the Spirit,
>Seen by angels,
>Proclaimed among Gentiles,
>Believed on in the world,
>Taken up in glory.
