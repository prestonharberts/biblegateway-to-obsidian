## Introduction
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>This is the Lord’s message that came to Micah of Moresheth during the time of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
## The Judge is Coming
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Listen, all you nations!
>Pay attention, all inhabitants of earth!
>The Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ will act as a witness against you;
>The Lord will accuse you from his majestic palace.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Look, the Lᴏʀᴅ is coming out of his dwelling place!
>He will descend and march on the earth’s mountaintops!
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>The mountains will crumble beneath him,
>And the valleys will split apart
>Like wax before a fire,
>Like water dumped down a steep slope.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>All this is because of Jacob’s rebellion
>And the sins of the nation of Israel.
>And just what is Jacob’s rebellion?
>Isn’t it Samaria’s doings?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And what is Judah’s sin?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Isn’t it Jerusalem’s doings?
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will turn Samaria into a heap of ruins in an open field,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Into a place for planting vineyards.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will dump the rubble of her walls down into the valley
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And lay bare her foundations.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All her carved idols will be smashed to pieces;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All her metal cult statues will be destroyed by fire.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will make a waste heap of all her images.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Since she gathered the metal as a prostitute collects her wages,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The idols will become a prostitute’s wages again.”

###### 8
><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span>For this reason I will mourn and wail;
>I will walk around barefoot and without my outer garments.
>I will howl like a wild dog,
>And screech like an owl.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>For Samaria’s disease is incurable.
>It has infected Judah;
>It has spread to the leadership of my people
>And even to Jerusalem!
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Don’t spread the news in Gath.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Don’t shed even a single tear.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In Beth Leaphrah roll about in mourning in the dust!
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Residents of Shaphir, pass by in nakedness and humiliation!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The residents of Zaanan have not escaped.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Beth Ezel mourns,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He takes from you what he desires.”
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Indeed, the residents of Maroth hope for something good to happen,
>Though the Lᴏʀᴅ has sent disaster against the city of Jerusalem.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>Residents of Lachish, hitch the horses to the chariots!
>You influenced Daughter Zion to sin,
>For Israel’s rebellious deeds can be traced back to you!
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>Therefore you will have to say farewell to Moresheth Gath.
>The residents of Achzib will be as disappointing
>As a dried up well to the kings of Israel.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>Residents of Mareshah, a conqueror will attack you;
>The leaders of Israel shall flee to Adullam.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>Shave your heads bald as you mourn for the children you love;
>Shave your foreheads as bald as an eagle,
>For they are taken from you into exile.
