## Title
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The words of the Teacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:
## Introduction: Utter Futility
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Futile! Futile!” laments the Teacher.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Absolutely futile! Everything is futile!”
## Futility Illustrated from Nature
###### 3
><span class=verse-first-poetry>3</span>What benefit do people get from all the effort
>Which they expend on earth?
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>A generation comes and a generation goes,
>But the earth remains the same through the ages.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>The sun rises and the sun sets;
>It hurries away to a place from which it rises again.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>The wind goes to the south and circles around to the north;
>Round and round the wind goes and on its rounds it returns.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>All the streams flow into the sea, but the sea is not full,
>And to the place where the streams flow, there they will flow again.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>All this monotony is tiresome; no one can bear to describe it.
>The eye is never satisfied with seeing, nor is the ear ever content with hearing.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>What exists now is what will be,
>And what has been done is what will be done;
>There is nothing truly new on earth.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Is there anything about which someone can say, “Look at this! It is new”?
>It was already done long ago, before our time.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>No one remembers the former events,
>Nor will anyone remember the events that are yet to happen;
>They will not be remembered by the future generations.
## Futility of Secular Accomplishment
###### 12
><span class=verse-first-poetry>12</span>I, the Teacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>I decided to carefully and thoroughly examine
>All that has been accomplished on earth.
>I concluded: God has given people a burdensome task
>That keeps them occupied.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>I reflected on everything that is accomplished by man on earth,
>And I concluded: Everything he has accomplished is futile—like chasing the wind!
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>What is bent cannot be straightened,
>And what is missing cannot be supplied.
## Futility of Secular Wisdom
###### 16
><span class=verse-first-poetry>16</span>I thought to myself,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have become much wiser than any of my predecessors who ruled over Jerusalem;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have acquired much wisdom and knowledge.”
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>So I decided to discern the benefit of wisdom and knowledge over foolish behavior and ideas;
>However, I concluded that even this endeavor is like trying to chase the wind.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>For with great wisdom comes great frustration;
>Whoever increases his knowledge merely increases his heartache.
