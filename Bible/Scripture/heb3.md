## Jesus and Moses
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, partners in a heavenly calling, take note of Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess,
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>who is faithful to the one who appointed him, as Moses was also in God’s house.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>For he has come to deserve greater glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house deserves greater honor than the house itself!
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>Now Moses was faithful in all God’s house as a servant, to testify to the things that would be spoken.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>But Christ is faithful as a son over God’s house. We are of his house, if in fact we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope we take pride in.
## Exposition of Psalm 95: Hearing God’s Word in Faith
###### 7
<span class=verse-first>7</span>Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Oh, that today you would listen as he speaks!
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, in the day of testing in the wilderness.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There your fathers tested me and tried me, and they saw my works for forty years.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Therefore, I became provoked at that generation and said, ‘Their hearts are always wandering and they have not known my ways.’
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As I swore in my anger, ‘They will never enter my rest!’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>See to it, brothers and sisters, that none of you has an evil, unbelieving heart that forsakes the living God.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>But exhort one another each day, as long as it is called “Today,” that none of you may become hardened by sin’s deception.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>For we have become partners with Christ, if in fact we hold our initial confidence firm until the end.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>As it says, “Oh, that today you would listen as he speaks! Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>For which ones heard and rebelled? Was it not all who came out of Egypt under Moses’ leadership?
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>And against whom was God provoked for forty years? Was it not those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness?
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>And to whom did he swear they would never enter into his rest, except those who were disobedient?
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>So we see that they could not enter because of unbelief.
