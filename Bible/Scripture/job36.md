><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Be patient with me a little longer
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I will instruct you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I still have words to speak on God’s behalf.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>With my knowledge I will speak comprehensively,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And to my Creator I will ascribe righteousness.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For in truth, my words are not false;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It is one complete in knowledge
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who is with you.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, God is mighty; and he does not despise people,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He is mighty, and firm in his intent.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He does not allow the wicked to live,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But he gives justice to the poor.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He does not take his eyes off the righteous;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But with kings on the throne
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He seats the righteous and exalts them forever.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But if they are bound in chains,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And held captive by the cords of affliction,
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then he reveals to them what they have done,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And their transgressions,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That they were behaving proudly.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And he reveals this for correction,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And says that they must turn from evil.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If they obey and serve him,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They live out their days in prosperity
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And their years in pleasantness.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But if they refuse to listen,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They pass over the river of death,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And expire without knowledge.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The godless at heart nourish anger,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They do not cry out even when he binds them.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They die in their youth,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And their life ends among the male cultic prostitutes.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He delivers the afflicted by their afflictions,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He reveals himself to them by their suffering.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And surely, he drew you from the mouth of distress,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To a wide place, unrestricted,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And to the comfort of your table
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Filled with rich food.

###### 17
><span class=verse-first-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But now you are preoccupied with the judgment due the wicked,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Judgment and justice take hold of you.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Be careful that no one entices you with riches;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not let a large bribe turn you aside.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Would your wealth sustain you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So that you would not be in distress,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even all your mighty efforts?
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not long for the cover of night
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To drag people away from their homes.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Take heed, do not turn to evil,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For because of this you have been tested by affliction.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, God is exalted in his power;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who is a teacher like him?
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who has prescribed his ways for him?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or said to him, ‘You have done what is wicked’?
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 24
><span class=verse-first-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Remember to extol his work,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Which people have praised in song.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All humanity has seen it;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>People gaze on it from afar.”
## The Work and Wisdom of God

><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yes, God is great—beyond our knowledge!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The number of his years is unsearchable.
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He draws up drops of water;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They distill the rain into its mist,
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Which the clouds pour down
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And shower on humankind abundantly.
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who can understand the spreading of the clouds,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The thunderings of his pavilion?
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>See how he scattered his lightning about him;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He has covered the depths of the sea.
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It is by these that he judges the nations
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And supplies food in abundance.
###### 32
><span class=verse-body-poetry>32</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>With his hands he covers the lightning,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And directs it against its target.
###### 33
><span class=verse-body-poetry>33</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His thunder announces the coming storm,
