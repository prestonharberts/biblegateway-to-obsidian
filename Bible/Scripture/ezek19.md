<span class=verse-body>2</span>“and say:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>‘What a lioness was your mother among the lions!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>She lay among young lions; she reared her cubs.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>She reared one of her cubs; he became a young lion.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He learned to tear prey; he devoured people.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The nations heard about him; he was trapped in their pit.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>When she realized that she waited in vain, her hope was lost.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>She took another of her cubs and made him a young lion.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He walked about among the lions; he became a young lion.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He learned to tear prey; he devoured people.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He broke down their strongholds and devastated their cities.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The land and everything in it was frightened at the sound of his roaring.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The nations—the surrounding regions—attacked him.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They threw their net over him; he was caught in their pit.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They put him in a collar with hooks;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They brought him to the king of Babylon;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They brought him to prison
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>So that his voice would not be heard
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Any longer on the mountains of Israel.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard, planted by water.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>It was fruitful and full of branches because it was well-watered.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Its boughs were strong, fit for rulers’ scepters; it reached up into the clouds.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>It stood out because of its height and its many branches.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>But it was plucked up in anger; it was thrown down to the ground.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The east wind dried up its fruit;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Its strong branches broke off and withered—
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>A fire consumed them.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Now it is planted in the wilderness,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>In a dry and thirsty land.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>A fire has gone out from its branch; it has consumed its shoot and its fruit.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>No strong branch was left in it, nor a scepter to rule.’
