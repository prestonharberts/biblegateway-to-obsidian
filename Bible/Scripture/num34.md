## The Southern Border of the Land
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Then the Lᴏʀᴅ spoke to Moses:
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“Give these instructions to the Israelites, and tell them: ‘When you enter Canaan, the land that has been assigned to you as an inheritance, the land of Canaan with its borders,
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>‘your southern border will extend from the wilderness of Zin along the Edomite border, and your southern border will run eastward to the extremity of the Salt Sea,
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>‘and then the border will turn from the south to the Scorpion Ascent, continue to Zin, and then its direction will be from the south to Kadesh Barnea. Then it will go to Hazar Addar and pass over to Azmon.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>‘There the border will turn from Azmon to the Stream of Egypt, and then its direction is to the sea.’
## The Western Border of the Land
###### 6
<span class=verse-first>6</span>“‘And for a western border you will have the Great Sea. This will be your western border.’”
## The Northern Border of the Land
###### 7
<span class=verse-first>7</span>“‘And this will be your northern border: From the Great Sea you will draw a line to Mount Hor;
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>‘from Mount Hor you will draw a line to Lebo Hamath, and the direction of the border will be to Zedad.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>‘The border will continue to Ziphron, and its direction will be to Hazar Enan. This will be your northern border.’
## The Eastern Border of the Land
###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>“‘For your eastern border you will draw a line from Hazar Enan to Shepham.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>‘The border will run down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain, and the border will descend and reach the eastern side of the Sea of Kinnereth.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>‘Then the border will continue down the Jordan River and its direction will be to the Salt Sea. This will be your land by its borders that surround it.’”

###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>Then Moses commanded the Israelites: “This is the land that you will inherit by lot, which the Lᴏʀᴅ has commanded to be given to the nine-and-a-half tribes,
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>“because the tribe of the Reubenites by their families, the tribe of the Gadites by their families, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>“The two-and-a-half tribes have received their inheritance on this side of the Jordan, east of Jericho, toward the sunrise.”
## Appointed Officials
###### 16
<span class=verse-first>16</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said to Moses:

<span class=verse-body>17</span>“These are the names of the men who are to allocate the land to you as an inheritance: Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>“You must take one leader from every tribe to assist in allocating the land as an inheritance.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>“These are the names of the men: from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh;
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>“from the tribe of the Simeonites, Shemuel son of Ammihud;
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>“from the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad son of Kislon;
