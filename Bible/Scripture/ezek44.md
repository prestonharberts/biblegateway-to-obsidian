## The Closed Gate
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Then he brought me back by way of the outer gate of the sanctuary that faces east, but it was shut.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said to me: “This gate will be shut; it will not be opened, and no one will enter by it. For the Lᴏʀᴅ, the God of Israel, has entered by it; therefore it will remain shut.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“Only the prince may sit in it to eat a sacrificial meal before the Lᴏʀᴅ; he will enter by way of the porch of the gate and will go out by the same way.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 4
<span class=verse-first>4</span>Then he brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple. As I watched, I noticed the glory of the Lᴏʀᴅ filling the Lord’s temple, and I threw myself face down.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said to me: “Son of man, pay attention, watch closely, and listen carefully to everything I tell you concerning all the statutes of the Lord’s house and all its laws. Pay attention to the entrances to the temple with all the exits of the sanctuary.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>“Say to the rebellious, to the house of Israel, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says: Enough of all your abominable practices, O house of Israel!
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>‘When you bring foreigners, those uncircumcised in heart and in flesh, into my sanctuary, you desecrate it—even my house—when you offer my food, the fat and the blood. You have broken my covenant by all your abominable practices.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>‘You have not kept charge of my holy things, but you have assigned foreigners to keep charge of my sanctuary for you.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
<span class=verse-first>9</span>‘This is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says: No foreigner who is uncircumcised in heart and flesh among all the foreigners who are among the people of Israel will enter into my sanctuary.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“‘But the Levites who went far from me, straying off from me after their idols when Israel went astray, will be responsible for their sin.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>‘Yet they will be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the temple, and serving the temple. They will slaughter the burnt offerings and the sacrifices for the people, and they will stand before them to minister to them.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>‘Because they used to minister to them before their idols and became a sinful obstacle to the house of Israel, consequently I have made a vow concerning them, declares the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ, that they will be responsible for their sin.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>‘They will not come near me to serve me as priest, nor will they come near any of my holy things, the things that are most sacred. They will bear the shame of the abominable deeds they have committed.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>‘Yet I will appoint them to keep charge of the temple, all its service, and all that will be done in it.’
## The Levitical Priests
###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>“‘But the Levitical priests, the descendants of Zadok who kept the charge of my sanctuary when the people of Israel went astray from me, will approach me to minister to me; they will stand before me to offer me the fat and the blood, declares the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>‘They will enter my sanctuary and approach my table to minister to me; they will keep my charge.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>“‘When they enter the gates of the inner court, they must wear linen garments; they must not have any wool on them when they minister in the inner gates of the court and in the temple.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>‘Linen turbans will be on their heads and linen undergarments will be around their waists; they must not bind themselves with anything that causes sweat.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>‘When they go out to the outer court to the people, they must remove the garments they were ministering in and place them in the holy chambers; they must put on other garments so that they will not transmit holiness to the people with their garments.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>“‘They must not shave their heads nor let their hair grow long; they must only trim their heads.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>‘No priest may drink wine when he enters the inner court.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>‘They must not marry a widow or a divorcee, but they may marry a virgin from the house of Israel or a widow who is a priest’s widow.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>‘Moreover, they will teach my people the difference between the holy and the common and show them how to distinguish between the ceremonially unclean and the clean.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>“‘In a controversy they will act as judges; they will judge according to my ordinances. They will keep my laws and my statutes regarding all my appointed festivals and will observe my Sabbaths.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>“‘They must not come near a dead person or they will be defiled; however, for father, mother, son, daughter, brother, or unmarried sister, they may defile themselves.
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>‘After a priest has become ceremonially clean, they must count off a period of seven days for him.
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>‘On the day he enters the sanctuary into the inner court to serve in the sanctuary, he must offer his sin offering, declares the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 28
<span class=verse-first>28</span>“‘This will be their inheritance: I am their inheritance, and you must give them no property in Israel; I am their property.
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>‘They may eat the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering, and every devoted thing in Israel will be theirs.
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>‘The first of all the firstfruits and all contributions of any kind will be for the priests; you will also give to the priest the first portion of your dough, so that a blessing may rest on your house.
###### 31
<span class=verse-body>31</span>‘The priests will not eat any bird or animal that has died a natural death or was torn to pieces by a wild animal.’”
