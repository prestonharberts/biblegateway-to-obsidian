><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why are times not appointed by the Almighty?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why do those who know him not see his days?
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Men move boundary stones;

###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They drive away the orphan’s donkey;

###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They turn the needy from the pathway,

###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like wild donkeys in the wilderness,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They go out to their labor seeking diligently for food;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The arid rift valley provides food for them and for their children.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They reap fodder in the field,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And glean in the vineyard of the wicked.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They spend the night naked because they lack clothing;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They have no covering against the cold.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are soaked by mountain rains
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And huddle in the rocks because they lack shelter.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The fatherless child is snatched from the breast,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The infant of the poor is taken as a pledge.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They go about naked, without clothing,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And go hungry while they carry the sheaves.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They press out the olive oil between the rows of olive trees;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They tread the winepresses while they are thirsty.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>From the city the dying groan,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the wounded cry out for help,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But God charges no one with wrongdoing.

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There are those who rebel against the light;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They do not know its ways
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And they do not stay on its paths.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Before daybreak the murderer rises up;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He kills the poor and the needy;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In the night he is like a thief.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the eye of the adulterer watches for the twilight,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Thinking, ‘No eye can see me,’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And covers his face with a mask.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In the dark the robber breaks into houses,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But by day they shut themselves in;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They do not know the light.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For all of them, the morning is to them like deep darkness;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are friends with the terrors of darkness.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
><span class=verse-first-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You say, ‘He is foam on the face of the waters;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Their portion of the land is cursed
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>So that no one goes to their vineyard.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The drought as well as the heat
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Snatch up the melted snow;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>So the grave snatches up the sinner.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The womb forgets him,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The worm feasts on him,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>No longer will he be remembered.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Like a tree, wickedness will be broken down.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He preys on the barren and childless woman,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And does not treat the widow well.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 22
><span class=verse-first-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>But God drags off the mighty by his power;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>When God rises up against him, he has no faith in his life.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>God may let them rest in a feeling of security,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>But he is constantly watching all their ways.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They are exalted for a little while, and then they are gone,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They are brought low like all others, and gathered in,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And like a head of grain they are cut off.’
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If this is not so, who can prove me a liar
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And reduce my words to nothing?”
