###### 2
><span class=verse-first-poetry>2</span>My beloved has gone down to his garden,
>To the flowerbeds of balsam spices,
>To graze in the gardens,
>And to gather lilies.
## Poetic Refrain: Mutual Possession
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>I am my lover’s and my lover is mine;
>He grazes among the lilies.
## The Renewal of Love
###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span>My darling, you are as beautiful as Tirzah,
>As lovely as Jerusalem,
>As awe-inspiring as bannered armies.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Turn your eyes away from me—
>They overwhelm me!
>Your hair is like a flock of goats
>Descending from Mount Gilead.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Your teeth are like a flock of sheep
>Coming up from the washing;
>Each has its twin;
>Not one of them is missing.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Like a slice of pomegranate
>Is your forehead behind your veil.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>There may be sixty queens,
>And eighty concubines,
>And young women without number.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>But she is unique,
>My dove, my perfect one!
>She is the special daughter of her mother;
>She is the favorite of the one who bore her.
>The maidens saw her and complimented her;
>The queens and concubines praised her:
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who is this who appears like the dawn?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Beautiful as the moon, bright as the sun,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Awe-inspiring as the stars in procession?”
## The Return to the Vineyards
###### 11
><span class=verse-first-poetry>11</span>I went down to the orchard of walnut trees,
>To look for the blossoms of the valley,
>To see if the vines had budded
>Or if the pomegranates were in bloom.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>I was beside myself with joy!
>There please give me your myrrh,
>O daughter of my princely people.
## The Love Song and Dance
###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span> Turn, turn, O Perfect One!
Turn, turn, that I may stare at you!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

>Why do you gaze upon the Perfect One
>Like the dance of the Mahanaim?
