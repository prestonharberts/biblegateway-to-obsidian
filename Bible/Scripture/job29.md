###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Then Job continued his speech:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>O that I could be as I was
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In the months now gone,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In the days when God watched over me,
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When he caused his lamp
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To shine upon my head,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And by his light
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I walked through darkness;
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Just as I was in my most productive time,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When God’s intimate friendship was experienced in my tent,
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When the Almighty was still with me
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And my children were around me;
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When my steps were bathed with butter
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the rock poured out for me streams of olive oil!
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When I went out to the city gate
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And secured my seat in the public square,
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The young men would see me and step aside,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the old men would get up and remain standing;
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The chief men refrained from talking
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And covered their mouths with their hands;
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The voices of the nobles fell silent,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.”
## Job’s Benevolence
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As soon as the ear heard these things, it blessed me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And when the eye saw them, it bore witness to me,
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I rescued the poor who cried out for help,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the orphan who had no one to assist him;
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The blessing of the dying man descended on me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I made the widow’s heart rejoice;
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I put on righteousness and it clothed me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My just dealing was like a robe and a turban;
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I was eyes for the blind
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And feet for the lame;
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I was a father to the needy,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I investigated the case of the person I did not know;
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I broke the fangs of the wicked,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And made him drop his prey from his teeth.”
## Job’s Confidence
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then I thought, ‘I will die in my own home,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>My days as numerous as the grains of sand.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>My roots reach the water,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And the dew lies on my branches all night long.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>My glory will always be fresh in me,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And my bow ever new in my hand.’
## Job’s Reputation
###### 21
><span class=verse-first-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>People listened to me and waited silently;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They kept silent for my advice.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>After I had spoken, they did not respond;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My words fell on them drop by drop.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They waited for me as people wait for the rain,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And they opened their mouths as for the spring rains.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If I smiled at them, they hardly believed it;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And they did not cause the light of my face to darken.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I chose the way for them
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And sat as their chief;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I lived like a king among his troops;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I was like one who comforts mourners.
