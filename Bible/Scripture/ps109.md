###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>O God whom I praise, do not ignore me.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>For they say cruel and deceptive things to me;
>They lie to me.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>They surround me and say hateful things;
>They attack me for no reason.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>They repay my love with accusations,
>But I continue to pray.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>They repay me evil for good,
>And hate for love.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 6
><span class=verse-first-poetry>6</span>Appoint an evil man to testify against him.
>May an accuser stand at his right side.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>When he is judged, he will be found guilty.
>Then his prayer will be regarded as sinful.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>May his days be few.
>May another take his job.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>May his children be fatherless,
>And his wife a widow.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>May his children roam around begging,
>Asking for handouts as they leave their ruined home.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>May the creditor seize all he owns.
>May strangers loot his property.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>May no one show him kindness.
>May no one have compassion on his fatherless children.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>May his descendants be cut off.
>May the memory of them be wiped out by the time the next generation arrives.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
><span class=verse-first-poetry>14</span>May his ancestors’ sins be remembered by the Lᴏʀᴅ.
>May his mother’s sin not be forgotten.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>May the Lᴏʀᴅ be constantly aware of them,
>And cut off the memory of his children from the earth.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>For he never bothered to show kindness;
>He harassed the oppressed and needy,
>And killed the disheartened.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>He loved to curse others, so those curses have come upon him.
>He had no desire to bless anyone, so he has experienced no blessings.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>He made cursing a way of life,
>So curses poured into his stomach like water
>And seeped into his bones like oil.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>May a curse attach itself to him, like a garment one puts on,
>Or a belt one wears continually.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>May the Lᴏʀᴅ repay my accusers in this way,
>Those who say evil things about me.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 21
><span class=verse-first-poetry>21</span>O Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ,
>Intervene on my behalf for the sake of your reputation.
>Because your loyal love is good, deliver me.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>For I am oppressed and needy,
>And my heart beats violently within me.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span>I am fading away like a shadow at the end of the day;
>I am shaken off like a locust.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span>I am so starved my knees shake;
>I have turned into skin and bones.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span>I am disdained by them.
>When they see me, they shake their heads.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 26
><span class=verse-first-poetry>26</span>Help me, O Lᴏʀᴅ my God.
>Because you are faithful to me, deliver me.
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span>Then they will realize this is your work,
>And that you, Lᴏʀᴅ, have accomplished it.
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span>They curse, but you will bless.
>When they attack, they will be humiliated,
>But your servant will rejoice.
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span>My accusers will be covered with shame,
>And draped in humiliation as if it were a robe.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 30
><span class=verse-first-poetry>30</span>I will thank the Lᴏʀᴅ profusely.
>In the middle of a crowd I will praise him,
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span>Because he stands at the right hand of the needy,
>To deliver him from those who threaten his life.
