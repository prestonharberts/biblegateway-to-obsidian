## Admonition to Avoid Easy but Unjust Riches
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>My child, if sinners try to entice you,
>Do not consent!
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>If they say, “Come with us!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We will lie in wait to shed blood;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We will ambush an innocent person capriciously.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We will swallow them alive like Sheol,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those full of vigor like those going down to the Pit.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We will seize all kinds of precious wealth;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We will fill our houses with plunder.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Join with us!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We will all share equally in what we steal.”

><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>My child, do not go down their way,

###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>Surely it is futile to spread a net
>In plain sight of any bird,
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>But these men lie in wait for their own blood,
>They ambush their own lives!
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>Such are the ways of all who gain profit unjustly;
>It takes away the life of those who obtain it!
## Warning Against Disregarding Wisdom
###### 20
><span class=verse-first-poetry>20</span>Wisdom calls out in the street,
>She shouts loudly in the plazas;
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>At the head of the noisy streets she calls,
>In the entrances of the gates in the city she utters her words:
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How long will you simpletons love naiveté?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How long have mockers delighted in mockery?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And how long will fools hate knowledge?
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You should respond to my rebuke.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then I would pour out my thoughts to you;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I would make my words known to you.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>However, because I called but you refused to listen,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because I stretched out my hand but no one was paying attention,
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And you neglected all my advice,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And did not comply with my rebuke,
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So I myself will laugh when disaster strikes you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will mock when what you dread comes,
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When what you dread comes like a whirlwind,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And disaster strikes you like a devastating storm,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When distressing trouble comes on you.
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then they will call to me, but I will not answer;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will diligently seek me, but they will not find me.
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because they hated moral knowledge,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And did not choose to fear the Lᴏʀᴅ,
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They did not comply with my advice,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They spurned all my rebuke.
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Therefore they will eat from the fruit of their way,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And they will be stuffed full of their own counsel.
###### 32
><span class=verse-body-poetry>32</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the waywardness of the
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Simpletons will kill them,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the careless ease of fools will destroy them.
###### 33
><span class=verse-body-poetry>33</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But the one who listens to me will live in security,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And will be at ease from the dread of harm.”
