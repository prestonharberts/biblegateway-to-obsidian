## Elihu Invites Job’s Attention
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But now, O Job, listen to my words,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And hear everything I have to say.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>See now, I have opened my mouth;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My tongue in my mouth has spoken.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My words come from the uprightness of my heart,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And my lips will utter knowledge sincerely.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Spirit of God has made me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Reply to me, if you can;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Set your arguments in order before me
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And take your stand.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, I am just like you in relation to God;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I too have been molded from clay.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Therefore no fear of me should terrify you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Nor should my pressure be heavy on you.”
## Elihu Rejects Job’s Plea of Innocence
###### 8
><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, you have said in my hearing
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>(I heard the sound of the words!):
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I am pure, without transgression;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I am clean and have no iniquity.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Yet God finds occasions with me;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He regards me as his enemy.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He puts my feet in shackles;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He watches closely all my paths.’
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Now in this, you are not right—I answer you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For God is greater than a human being.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why do you contend against him,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That he does not answer all a person’s words?”
## Elihu Disagrees With Job’s View of God
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For God speaks, the first time in one way,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The second time in another,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Though a person does not perceive it.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In a dream, a night vision,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When deep sleep falls on people
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As they sleep in their beds.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then he gives a revelation to people,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And terrifies them with warnings,
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To turn a person from his sin,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And to cover a person’s pride.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He spares a person’s life from corruption,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His very life from crossing over the river.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 19
><span class=verse-first-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or a person is chastened by pain on his bed,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And with the continual strife of his bones,
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So that his life loathes food,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And his soul rejects appetizing fare.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His flesh wastes away from sight,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And his bones, which were not seen,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Are easily visible.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He draws near to the place of corruption,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And his life to the messengers of death.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 23
><span class=verse-first-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If there is an angel beside him,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>One mediator out of a thousand,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To tell a person what constitutes his uprightness;
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And if God is gracious to him and says,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Spare him from going down
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>To the place of corruption,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I have found a ransom for him,’
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then his flesh is restored like a youth’s;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He returns to the days of his youthful vigor.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He entreats God, and God delights in him,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He sees God’s face with rejoicing,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And God restores to him his righteousness.
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That person sings to others, saying:
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I have sinned and falsified what is right,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>But I was not punished according to what I deserved.
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He redeemed my life
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>From going down to the place of corruption,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And my life sees the light!’
## Elihu’s Appeal to Job
###### 29
><span class=verse-first-poetry>29</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, God does all these things,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Twice, three times, in his dealings with a person,
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To turn back his life from the place of corruption,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That he may be enlightened with the light of life.
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Pay attention, Job—listen to me;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Be silent, and I will speak.
###### 32
><span class=verse-body-poetry>32</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If you have any words, reply to me;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Speak, for I want to justify you.
###### 33
><span class=verse-body-poetry>33</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If not, you listen to me;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.”
