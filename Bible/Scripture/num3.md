## The Sons of Aaron
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Now these are the records of Aaron and Moses when the Lᴏʀᴅ spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>These are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the anointed priests, whom he consecrated to minister as priests.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>Nadab and Abihu died before the Lᴏʀᴅ when they offered strange fire before the Lᴏʀᴅ in the desert of Sinai, and they had no children. So Eleazar and Ithamar ministered as priests in the presence of Aaron their father.
## The Assignment of the Levites
###### 5
<span class=verse-first>5</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ spoke to Moses:
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>“Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the priest, that they may serve him.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“They are responsible for his needs and the needs of the whole community before the tent of meeting, by attending to the service of the tabernacle.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>“And they are responsible for all the furnishings of the tent of meeting, and for the needs of the Israelites, as they serve in the tabernacle.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>“You are to assign the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they will be assigned exclusively to him out of all the Israelites.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“So you are to appoint Aaron and his sons, and they will be responsible for their priesthood, but the unauthorized person who comes near must be put to death.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>Then the Lᴏʀᴅ spoke to Moses:
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>“Look, I myself have taken the Levites from among the Israelites instead of every firstborn who opens the womb among the Israelites. So the Levites belong to me,
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>“because all the firstborn are mine. When I destroyed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I set apart for myself all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast. They belong to me. I am the Lᴏʀᴅ.”
## The Numbering of the Levites
###### 14
<span class=verse-first>14</span>Then the Lᴏʀᴅ spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai:
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>“Number the Levites by their clans and their families; every male from a month old and upward you are to number.”
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>So Moses numbered them according to the word of the Lᴏʀᴅ, just as he had been commanded.

## The Substitution for the Firstborn
###### 40
<span class=verse-first>40</span>Then the Lᴏʀᴅ said to Moses, “Number all the firstborn males of the Israelites from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names.
###### 41
<span class=verse-body>41</span>“And take the Levites for me—I am the Lᴏʀᴅ—instead of all the firstborn males among the Israelites, and the livestock of the Levites instead of all the firstborn of the livestock of the Israelites.”
###### 42
<span class=verse-body>42</span>So Moses numbered all the firstborn males among the Israelites, as the Lᴏʀᴅ had commanded him.
###### 43
<span class=verse-body>43</span>And all the firstborn males, by the number of the names from a month old and upward, totaled 22,273.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 44
<span class=verse-first>44</span>Then the Lᴏʀᴅ spoke to Moses:
###### 45
<span class=verse-body>45</span>“Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn males among the Israelites, and the livestock of the Levites instead of their livestock. And the Levites will be mine. I am the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 46
<span class=verse-body>46</span>“And for the redemption of the 273 firstborn males of the Israelites who exceed the number of the Levites,
###### 47
<span class=verse-body>47</span>“collect five shekels for each one individually; you are to collect this amount in the currency of the sanctuary shekel (this shekel is twenty gerahs).
###### 48
<span class=verse-body>48</span>“And give the money for the redemption of the excess number of them to Aaron and his sons.”
###### 49
<span class=verse-body>49</span>So Moses took the redemption money from those who were in excess of those redeemed by the Levites.
###### 50
<span class=verse-body>50</span>From the firstborn males of the Israelites he collected the money, 1,365 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel.
###### 51
<span class=verse-body>51</span>Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and his sons, according to the word of the Lᴏʀᴅ, as the Lᴏʀᴅ had commanded Moses.
