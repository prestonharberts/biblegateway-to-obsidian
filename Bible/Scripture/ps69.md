###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Deliver me, O God,
>For the water has reached my neck.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>I sink into the deep mire
>Where there is no solid ground;
>I am in deep water,
>And the current overpowers me.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>I am exhausted from shouting for help.
>My throat is sore;
>My eyes grow tired from looking for my God.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>Those who hate me without cause
>Are more numerous than the hairs of my head.
>Those who want to destroy me,
>My enemies for no reason,
>Outnumber me.
>They make me repay what I did not steal.

>And they ridicule me.
###### 12
