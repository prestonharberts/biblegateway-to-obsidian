## Elijah Visits a Widow in Sidonian Territory
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Elijah the Tishbite, from Tishbe in Gilead, said to Ahab, “As certainly as the Lᴏʀᴅ God of Israel lives (whom I serve), there will be no dew or rain in the years ahead unless I give the command.”
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>The Lord’s message came to him:
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“Leave here and travel eastward. Hide out in the Kerith Valley near the Jordan.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“Drink from the stream; I have already told the ravens to bring you food there.”
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>So he carried out the Lᴏʀᴅ’s message; he went and lived in the Kerith Valley near the Jordan.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>The ravens would bring him bread and meat each morning and evening, and he would drink from the stream.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>After a while, the stream dried up because there had been no rain in the land.

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>The Lord’s message came to him,
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>“Get up, go to Zarephath in Sidonian territory, and live there. I have already told a widow who lives there to provide for you.”
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>So he got up and went to Zarephath. When he went through the city gate, there was a widow gathering wood. He called out to her, “Please give me a little water in a cup, so I can take a drink.”
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>As she went to get it, he called out to her, “Please bring me a piece of bread.”
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>She said, “As certainly as the Lᴏʀᴅ your God lives, I have no food, except for a handful of flour in a jar and a little olive oil in a jug. Right now I am gathering a couple of sticks for a fire. Then I’m going home to make one final meal for my son and myself. After we have eaten that, we will die of starvation.”
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>Elijah said to her, “Don’t be afraid. Go and do as you planned. But first make me a small cake and bring it to me; then make something for yourself and your son.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>“For this is what the Lᴏʀᴅ God of Israel has said: ‘The jar of flour will not be empty and the jug of oil will not run out until the day the Lᴏʀᴅ makes it rain on the surface of the ground.’”
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>She went and did as Elijah told her; there was always enough food for Elijah and for her and her family.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>The jar of flour was never empty and the jug of oil never ran out, in keeping with the Lord’s message that he had spoken through Elijah.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
<span class=verse-first>17</span>After this the son of the woman who owned the house got sick. His illness was so severe he could no longer breathe.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>She asked Elijah, “Why, prophet, have you come to me to confront me with my sin and kill my son?”
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>He said to her, “Hand me your son.” He took him from her arms, carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him down on his bed.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>Then he called out to the Lᴏʀᴅ, “O Lᴏʀᴅ, my God, are you also bringing disaster on this widow I am staying with by killing her son?”
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>He stretched out over the boy three times and called out to the Lᴏʀᴅ, “O Lᴏʀᴅ, my God, please let this boy’s breath return to him.”
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ answered Elijah’s prayer; the boy’s breath returned to him and he lived.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>Elijah took the boy, brought him down from the upper room to the house, and handed him to his mother. Elijah then said, “See, your son is alive!”
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>The woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a prophet and that the Lord’s message really does come through you.”
