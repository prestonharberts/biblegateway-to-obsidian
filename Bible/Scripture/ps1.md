## Book 1 (Psalms 1-41)
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>How blessed is the one who does not follow the advice of the wicked,
>Or stand in the pathway with sinners,
>Or sit in the assembly of scoffers.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Instead he finds pleasure in obeying the Lᴏʀᴅ’s commands;
>He meditates on his commands day and night.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>He is like a tree planted by flowing streams;
>It yields its fruit at the proper time,
>And its leaves never fall off.
>He succeeds in everything he attempts.

###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span>Not so with the wicked!
>Instead they are like wind-driven chaff.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>For this reason the wicked cannot withstand judgment,
>Nor can sinners join the assembly of the godly.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Certainly the Lᴏʀᴅ guards the way of the godly,
>But the way of the wicked ends in destruction.
