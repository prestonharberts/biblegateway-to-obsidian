## A Time for All Events in Life
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>For everything there is an appointed time,
>And an appropriate time for every activity on earth:
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>A time to be born, and a time to die;
>A time to plant, and a time to uproot what was planted;
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>A time to kill, and a time to heal;
>A time to break down, and a time to build up;
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>A time to weep, and a time to laugh;
>A time to mourn, and a time to dance.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>A time to throw away stones, and a time to gather stones;
>A time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>A time to search, and a time to give something up as lost;
>A time to keep, and a time to throw away;
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>A time to rip, and a time to sew;
>A time to keep silent, and a time to speak.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>A time to love, and a time to hate;
>A time for war, and a time for peace.
## Man is Ignorant of God’s Timing
###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span>What benefit can a worker gain from his toil?
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>I have observed the burden
>That God has given to people to keep them occupied.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>God has made everything fit beautifully in its appropriate time,
>But he has also placed ignorance in the human heart
>So that people cannot discover what God has ordained,
>From the beginning to the end of their lives.
## Enjoy Life in the Present
###### 12
><span class=verse-first-poetry>12</span>I have concluded that there is nothing better for people
>Than to be happy and to enjoy
>Themselves as long as they live,
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>And also that everyone should eat and drink, and find enjoyment in all his toil,
>For these things are a gift from God.
## God’s Sovereignty
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>I also know that whatever God does will endure forever;
>Nothing can be added to it, and nothing taken away from it.
>God has made it this way, so that men will fear him.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>Whatever exists now has already been, and whatever will be has already been;
>For God will seek to do again what has occurred in the past.
## The Problem of Injustice and Oppression
###### 16
><span class=verse-first-poetry>16</span>I saw something else on earth:
>In the place of justice, there was wickedness,
>And in the place of fairness, there was wickedness.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>I thought to myself, “God will judge both the righteous and the wicked;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For there is an appropriate time for every activity,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And there is a time of judgment for every deed.”
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>I also thought to myself, “It is for the sake of people,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So God can clearly show them that they are like animals.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the fate of humans and the fate of animals are the same:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As one dies, so dies the other; both have the same breath.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There is no advantage for humans over animals,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For both are fleeting.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Both go to the same place,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Both come from the dust,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And to dust both return.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who really knows if the human spirit ascends upward,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the animal’s spirit descends into the earth?”
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>So I perceived there is nothing better than for people to enjoy their work,
>Because that is their reward;
>For who can show them what the future holds?
