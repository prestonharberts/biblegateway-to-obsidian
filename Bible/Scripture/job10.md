## An Appeal for Revelation
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I am weary of my life;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will complain freely without restraint;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will say to God, ‘Do not condemn me;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Tell me why you are contending with me.’
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is it good for you to oppress,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To despise the work of your hands,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>While you smile
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>On the schemes of the wicked?”
## Motivations of God
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do you have eyes of flesh,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or do you see as a human being sees?
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Are your days like the days of a mortal,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or your years like the years of a mortal,
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That you must search out my iniquity,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And inquire about my sin,
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Although you know that I am not guilty,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And that there is no one who can deliver
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Out of your hand?”
## Contradictions in God’s Dealings
###### 8
><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your hands have shaped me and made me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But now you destroy me completely.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Remember that you have made me as with the clay;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will you return me to dust?
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Did you not pour me out like milk,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And curdle me like cheese?
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You clothed me with skin and flesh
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And knit me together with bones and sinews.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You gave me life and favor,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And your intervention watched over my spirit.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But these things you have concealed in your heart;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I know that this is with you:
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If I sinned, then you would watch me
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And you would not acquit me of my iniquity.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If I am guilty, woe to me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And if I am innocent, I cannot lift my head;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I am full of shame,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And satiated with my affliction.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If I lift myself up,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You hunt me as a fierce lion,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And again you display your power against me.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You bring new witnesses against me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And increase your anger against me;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Relief troops come against me.”
## An Appeal for Relief
###### 18
><span class=verse-first-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why then did you bring me out from the womb?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I should have died
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And no eye would have seen me!
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I should have been as though I had never existed;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I should have been carried
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Right from the womb to the grave!
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Are not my days few?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Cease, then, and leave me alone
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That I may find a little comfort,
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Before I depart, never to return,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To the land of darkness
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the deepest shadow,
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To the land of utter darkness,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like the deepest darkness,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the deepest shadow and disorder,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Where even the light is like darkness.”
