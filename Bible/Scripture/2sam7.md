<span class=verse-body>3</span>Nathan replied to the king, “You should go and do whatever you have in mind, for the Lᴏʀᴅ is with you.”

###### 4
<span class=verse-first>4</span>That night the Lord’s message came to Nathan,
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“Go, tell my servant David, ‘This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ has said: Do you really intend to build a house for me to live in?
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>‘I have not lived in a house from the time I brought the Israelites up from Egypt to the present day. Instead, I was traveling with them and living in a tent.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>‘Wherever I moved among all the Israelites, I did not say to any of their leaders whom I appointed to care for my people Israel, “Why have you not built me a house made from cedar?”’
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>“So now, say this to my servant David, ‘This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies has said: I took you from the pasture and from your work as a shepherd to make you leader of my people Israel.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>‘I was with you wherever you went, and I defeated all your enemies before you. Now I will make you as famous as the great men of the earth.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>‘I will establish a place for my people Israel and settle them there; they will live there and not be disturbed anymore. Violent men will not oppress them again, as they did in the beginning
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>‘and during the time when I appointed judges to lead my people Israel. Instead, I will give you relief from all your enemies. The Lᴏʀᴅ declares to you that he himself will build a dynastic house for you.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>‘When the time comes for you to die, I will raise up your descendant, one of your own sons, to succeed you, and I will establish his kingdom.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>‘He will build a house for my name, and I will make his dynasty permanent.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>‘I will become his father and he will become my son. When he sins, I will correct him with the rod of men and with wounds inflicted by human beings.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>‘But my loyal love will not be removed from him as I removed it from Saul, whom I removed from before you.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>‘Your house and your kingdom will stand before me permanently; your dynasty will be permanent.’”
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>Nathan told David all these words that were revealed to him.
## David Offers a Prayer to God
###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span>King David went in, sat before the Lᴏʀᴅ, and said, “Who am I, O Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ, and what is my family, that you should have brought me to this point?
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>“And you didn’t stop there, O Lᴏʀᴅ God! You have also spoken about the future of your servant’s family. Is this your usual way of dealing with men, O Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ?
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>“What more can David say to you? You have given your servant special recognition, O Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ!
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>“For the sake of your promise and according to your purpose you have done this great thing in order to reveal it to your servant.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>“Therefore you are great, O Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ, for there is none like you. There is no God besides you! What we have heard is true.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>“Who is like your people, Israel, a unique nation on the earth? Their God went to claim a nation for himself and to make a name for himself! You did great and awesome acts for your land, before your people whom you delivered for yourself from the Egyptian empire and its gods.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>“You made Israel your very own people for all time. You, O Lᴏʀᴅ, became their God.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>“So now, O Lᴏʀᴅ God, make this promise you have made about your servant and his family a permanent reality. Do as you promised,
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>“so you may gain lasting fame, as people say, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies is God over Israel!’ The dynasty of your servant David will be established before you,
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>“for you, O Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, have told your servant, ‘I will build you a dynastic house.’ That is why your servant has had the courage to pray this prayer to you.
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>“Now, O Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ, you are the true God. May your words prove to be true! You have made this good promise to your servant.
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>“Now be willing to bless your servant’s dynasty so that it may stand permanently before you, for you, O Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ, have spoken. By your blessing may your servant’s dynasty be blessed from now on into the future!”
