## III. Job’s Search for Wisdom [28:
## 1-28]
## No Known Road to Wisdom
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Surely there is a mine for silver,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And a place where gold is refined.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Iron is taken from the ground,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And rock is poured out as copper.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Man puts an end to the darkness;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He searches the farthest recesses
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the ore in the deepest darkness.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Far from where people live he sinks a shaft,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In places travelers have long forgotten,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Far from other people he dangles and sways.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The earth, from which food comes,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is overturned below as though by fire;
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A place whose stones are sapphires
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That contain dust of gold;
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A hidden path no bird of prey knows—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>No falcon’s eye has spotted it.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Proud beasts have not set foot on it,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And no lion has passed along it.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>On the flinty rock man has set to work with his hand;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He has overturned mountains at their bases.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He has cut out channels through the rocks;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His eyes have spotted every precious thing.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He has searched the sources of the rivers
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And what was hidden he has brought into the light.”
## No Price Can Buy Wisdom
###### 12
><span class=verse-first-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But wisdom—where can it be found?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Where is the place of understanding?
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Mankind does not know its place;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It cannot be found in the land of the living.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The deep says, ‘It is not with me.’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the sea says, ‘It is not with me.’
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Fine gold cannot be given in exchange for it,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Nor can its price be weighed out in silver.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It cannot be measured out for purchase with the gold of Ophir,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>With precious onyx or sapphires.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Neither gold nor crystal can be compared with it,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Nor can a vase of gold match its worth.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Of coral and jasper no mention will be made;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The price of wisdom is more than pearls.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The topaz of Cush cannot be compared with it;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It cannot be purchased with pure gold.”
## God Alone Has Wisdom
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But wisdom—where does it come from?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Where is the place of understanding?
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For it has been hidden
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>From the eyes of every living creature,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And from the birds of the sky it has been concealed.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Destruction and Death say,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>With our ears we have heard a rumor about where it can be found.’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 23
><span class=verse-first-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>God understands the way to it,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And he alone knows its place.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For he looks to the ends of the earth
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And observes everything under the heavens.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When he made the force of the wind
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And measured the waters with a gauge,
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When he imposed a limit for the rain,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And a path for the thunderstorm,
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then he looked at wisdom and assessed its value;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He established it and examined it closely.
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And he said to mankind,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The fear of the Lord—that is wisdom,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And to turn away from evil is understanding.’”
