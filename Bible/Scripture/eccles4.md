## Evil Oppression on Earth
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>So I again considered all the oppression that continually occurs on earth.
>This is what I saw:
>The oppressed were in tears, but no one was comforting them;
>No one delivers them from the power of their oppressors.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>So I considered those who are dead and gone
>More fortunate than those who are still alive.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>But better than both is the one who has not been born
>And has not seen the evil things that are done on earth.
## Labor Motivated by Envy
###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span>Then I considered all the skillful work that is done:
>Surely it is nothing more than competition between one person and another.
>This also is profitless—like chasing the wind.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>The fool folds his hands and does no work,
>So he has nothing to eat but his own flesh.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Better is one handful with some rest
>Than two hands full of toil and chasing the wind.
## Labor Motivated by Greed
###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span>So I again considered another futile thing on earth:
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>A man who is all alone with no companion,
>He has no children nor siblings;
>Yet there is no end to all his toil,
>And he is never satisfied with riches.
>He laments, “For whom am I toiling and depriving myself of pleasure?”
>This also is futile and a burdensome task!
## Labor is Beneficial When Its Rewards Are Shared
###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span>Two people are better than one,
>Because they can reap more benefit from their labor.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>For if they fall, one will help his companion up,
>But pity the person who falls down and has no one to help him up.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Furthermore, if two lie down together, they can keep each other warm,
>But how can one person keep warm by himself?
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Although an assailant may overpower one person,
>Two can withstand him.
>Moreover, a three-stranded cord is not quickly broken.
## Labor Motivated by Prestige Seeking
###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span>A poor but wise youth is better than an old and foolish king
>Who no longer knows how to receive advice.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>For he came out of prison to become king,
>Even though he had been born poor in what would become his kingdom.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>I considered all the living who walk on earth,
>As well as the successor who would arise in his place.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>There is no end to all the people nor to the past generations,
>Yet future generations will not rejoice in him.
>This also is profitless and like chasing the wind.
