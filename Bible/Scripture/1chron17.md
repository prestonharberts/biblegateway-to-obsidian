## God Makes a Promise to David
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>When David had settled into his palace, he said to Nathan the prophet, “Look, I am living in a palace made from cedar, while the ark of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s covenant is under a tent.”
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>Nathan said to David, “You should do whatever you have in mind, for God is with you.”

###### 3
<span class=verse-first>3</span>That night God told Nathan,
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“Go, tell my servant David: ‘This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ says: “You must not build me a house in which to live.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>‘For I have not lived in a house from the time I brought Israel up from Egypt to the present day. I have lived in a tent that has been in various places.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>‘Wherever I moved throughout Israel, I did not say to any of the leaders whom I appointed to care for my people Israel, ‘Why have you not built me a house made from cedar?’”’
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“So now, say this to my servant David: ‘This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies says: “I took you from the pasture and from your work as a shepherd to make you a leader of my people Israel.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>‘I was with you wherever you went and I defeated all your enemies before you. Now I will make you as famous as the great men of the earth.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>‘I will establish a place for my people Israel and settle them there; they will live there and not be disturbed anymore. Violent men will not oppress them again, as they did in the beginning
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>‘and during the time when I appointed judges to lead my people Israel. I will subdue all your enemies.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

“‘“I declare to you that the Lᴏʀᴅ will build a dynastic house for you!
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>‘When the time comes for you to die, I will raise up your descendant, one of your own sons, to succeed you, and I will establish his kingdom.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>‘He will build me a house, and I will make his dynasty permanent.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>‘I will become his father and he will become my son. I will never withhold my loyal love from him, as I withheld it from the one who ruled before you.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>‘I will put him in permanent charge of my house and my kingdom; his dynasty will be permanent.”’”
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>Nathan told David all these words that were revealed to him.
## David Praises God
###### 16
<span class=verse-first>16</span>King David went in, sat before the Lᴏʀᴅ, and said: “Who am I, O Lᴏʀᴅ God, and what is my family, that you should have brought me to this point?
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>“And you did not stop there, O God! You have also spoken about the future of your servant’s family. You have revealed to me what men long to know, O Lᴏʀᴅ God.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>“What more can David say to you? You have honored your servant; you have given your servant special recognition.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>“O Lᴏʀᴅ, for the sake of your servant and according to your will, you have done this great thing in order to reveal your greatness.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>“O Lᴏʀᴅ, there is none like you; there is no God besides you! What we heard is true!
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>“And who is like your people, Israel, a unique nation in the earth? Their God went to claim a nation for himself! You made a name for yourself by doing great and awesome deeds when you drove out nations before your people whom you had delivered from the Egyptian empire and its gods.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>“You made Israel your very own nation for all time. You, O Lᴏʀᴅ, became their God.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 23
<span class=verse-first>23</span>“So now, O Lᴏʀᴅ, may the promise you made about your servant and his family become a permanent reality! Do as you promised,
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>“so it may become a reality and you may gain lasting fame, as people say, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies is the God of Israel.’ The dynasty of your servant David will be established before you,
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>“for you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build a dynasty for him. That is why your servant has had the courage to pray to you.
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>“Now, O Lᴏʀᴅ, you are the true God; you have made this good promise to your servant.
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>“Now you are willing to bless your servant’s dynasty so that it may stand permanently before you, for you, O Lᴏʀᴅ, have blessed it and it will be blessed from now on into the future.”
