## The Words of Lemuel
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The words of King Lemuel, an oracle that his mother taught him:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 2
><span class=verse-first-poetry>2</span>O my son, O son of my womb,
>O son of my vows,
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Do not give your strength to women,
>Nor your ways to that which ruins kings.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>It is not for kings, O Lemuel,
>It is not for kings to drink wine,
>Or for rulers to crave strong drink,
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Lest they drink and forget what is decreed,
>And remove from all the poor their legal rights.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Give strong drink to the one who is perishing,
>And wine to those who are bitterly distressed;
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Let them drink and forget their poverty,
>And remember their misery no more.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Open your mouth on behalf of those unable to speak,
>For the legal rights of all the dying.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>Open your mouth, judge in righteousness,
>And plead the cause of the poor and needy.
## The Wife of Noble Character
###### 10
><span class=verse-first-poetry>10</span>Who can find a wife of noble character?
>For her value is far more than rubies.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Her husband’s heart has trusted her,
>And he does not lack the dividends.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>She has rewarded him with good and not harm
>All the days of her life.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>She sought out wool and flax,
>Then worked happily with her hands.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>She was like the merchant ships;
>She would bring in her food from afar.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>Then she rose while it was still night,
>And provided food for her household and a portion to her female servants.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>She considered a field and bought it;
>From her own income she planted a vineyard.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>She clothed herself in might,
>And she strengthened her arms.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>She perceived that her merchandise was good.
>Her lamp would not go out in the night.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>She extended her hands to the spool,
>And her hands grasped the spindle.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>She opened her hand to the poor,
>And extended her hands to the needy.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>She would not fear for her household in winter,
>Because all her household were clothed with scarlet,
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>Because she had made coverings for herself;
>And because her clothing was fine linen and purple.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span>Her husband is well-known in the city gate
>When he sits with the elders of the land.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span>She made linen garments then sold them,
>And traded belts to the merchants;
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span>Her clothing was strong and splendid;
>And she laughed at the time to come.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span>She has opened her mouth with wisdom,
>With loving instruction on her tongue.
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span>Watching over the ways of her household,
>She would not eat the bread of idleness.
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span>Her children have risen and called her blessed;
>Her husband also has praised her:
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Many daughters have done valiantly,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But you have surpassed them all!”
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span>Charm is deceitful and beauty is fleeting.
>A woman who fears the Lᴏʀᴅ—she makes herself praiseworthy.
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span>Give her credit for what she has accomplished,
>And let her works praise her in the city gates.
