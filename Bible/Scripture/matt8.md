## Cleansing a Leper
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>After he came down from the mountain, large crowds followed him.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>And a leper approached and bowed low before him, saying, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.”
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>He stretched out his hand and touched him saying, “I am willing. Be clean!” Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>Then Jesus said to him, “See that you do not speak to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest, and bring the offering that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”
## Healing the Centurion’s Servant
###### 5
<span class=verse-first>5</span>When he entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him asking for help:
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>“Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, in terrible anguish.”
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>Jesus said to him, “I will come and heal him.”
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>But the centurion replied, “Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof! Instead, just say the word and my servant will be healed.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>“For I too am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I say to this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes, and to another ‘Come!’ and he comes, and to my slave ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>When Jesus heard this he was amazed and said to those who followed him, “I tell you the truth, I have not found such faith in anyone in Israel!
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>“I tell you, many will come from the east and west to share the banquet with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven,
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>“but the sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go; just as you believed, it will be done for you.” And the servant was healed at that hour.
## Healings at Peter’s House
###### 14
<span class=verse-first>14</span>Now when Jesus entered Peter’s house, he saw his mother-in-law lying down, sick with a fever.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>He touched her hand, and the fever left her. Then she got up and began to serve them.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>When it was evening, many demon-possessed people were brought to him. He drove out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>In this way what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah was fulfilled:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He took our weaknesses and carried our diseases.”
## Challenging Professed Followers
###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span>Now when Jesus saw a large crowd around him, he gave orders to go to the other side of the lake.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>Then an expert in the law came to him and said, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>Jesus said to him, “Foxes have dens, and the birds in the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>Another of the disciples said to him, “Lord, let me first go and bury my father.”
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>But Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”
## Stilling of a Storm
###### 23
<span class=verse-first>23</span>As he got into the boat, his disciples followed him.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>And a great storm developed on the sea so that the waves began to swamp the boat. But he was asleep.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>So they came and woke him up saying, “Lord, save us! We are about to die!”
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>But he said to them, “Why are you cowardly, you people of little faith?” Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it was dead calm.
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>And the men were amazed and said, “What sort of person is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him!”
## Healing the Gadarene Demoniacs
###### 28
<span class=verse-first>28</span>When he came to the other side, to the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him. They were extremely violent, so that no one was able to pass by that way.
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>They cried out, “Son of God, leave us alone! Have you come here to torment us before the time?”
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>A large herd of pigs was feeding some distance from them.
###### 31
<span class=verse-body>31</span>Then the demons begged him, “If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.”
###### 32
<span class=verse-body>32</span>And he said, “Go!” So they came out and went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake and drowned in the water.
###### 33
<span class=verse-body>33</span>The herdsmen ran off, went into the town, and told everything that had happened to the demon-possessed men.
###### 34
<span class=verse-body>34</span>Then the entire town came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
