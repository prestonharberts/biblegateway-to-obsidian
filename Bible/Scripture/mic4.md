## Better Days Ahead for Jerusalem
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>And in future days the Lᴏʀᴅ’s Temple Mount will be the most important mountain of all;
>It will be more prominent than other hills.
>People will stream to it.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Many nations will come, saying,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Come on! Let’s go up to the Lᴏʀᴅ’s mountain,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To the temple of Jacob’s God,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So he can teach us his ways
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And we can live by his laws.”
>For instruction will proceed from Zion,
>The Lᴏʀᴅ’s message from Jerusalem.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>He will arbitrate between many peoples
>And settle disputes between many distant nations.
>They will beat their swords into plowshares,
>And their spears into pruning hooks.
>Nations will not use weapons against other nations,
>And they will no longer train for war.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>Each will sit under his own grapevine
>Or under his own fig tree without any fear.
>The Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies has decreed it.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Though all the nations follow their respective gods,
>We will follow the Lᴏʀᴅ our God forever.
## Restoration Will Follow Crisis
###### 6
><span class=verse-first-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In that day,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ, “I will gather the lame
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And assemble the outcasts whom I injured.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>I will transform the lame into the nucleus of a new nation,
>And those far off into a mighty nation.
>The Lᴏʀᴅ will reign over them on Mount Zion,
>From that day forward and forevermore.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>As for you, watchtower for the flock,
>Fortress of Daughter Zion—
>Your former dominion will be restored,
>The sovereignty that belongs to Daughter Jerusalem.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span>Jerusalem, why are you now shouting so loudly?
>Has your king disappeared?
>Has your wise leader been destroyed?
>Is this why pain grips you as if you were a woman in labor?
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Twist and strain, Daughter Zion, as if you were in labor!
>For you will leave the city
>And live in the open field.
>You will go to Babylon,
>But there you will be rescued.
>There the Lᴏʀᴅ will deliver you
>From the power of your enemies.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Many nations have now assembled against you.
>They say, “Jerusalem must be desecrated,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So we can gloat over Zion!”
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>But they do not know what the Lᴏʀᴅ is planning;
>They do not understand his strategy.
>He has gathered them like stalks of grain to be threshed at the threshing floor.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Get up and thresh, Daughter Zion!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I will give you iron horns;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will give you bronze hooves,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And you will crush many nations.”
>You will devote to the Lᴏʀᴅ the spoils you take from them
>And dedicate their wealth to the sovereign Ruler of the whole earth.
