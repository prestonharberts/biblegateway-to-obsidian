## Injustice Brings Alienation from God
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Look, the Lᴏʀᴅ’s hand is not too weak to deliver you;
>His ear is not too deaf to hear you.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>But your sinful acts have alienated you from your God;
>Your sins have caused him to reject you and not listen to your prayers.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>For your hands are stained with blood
>And your fingers with sin;
>Your lips speak lies,
>Your tongue utters malicious words.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>No one is concerned about justice;
>No one sets forth his case truthfully.
>They depend on false words and tell lies;
>They conceive of oppression
>And give birth to sin.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>They hatch the eggs of a poisonous snake
>And spin a spider’s web.
>Whoever eats their eggs will die,
>A poisonous snake is hatched.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Their webs cannot be used for clothing;
>They cannot cover themselves with what they make.
>Their deeds are sinful;
>They commit violent crimes.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>They are eager to do evil,
>Quick to shed innocent blood.
>Their thoughts are sinful;
>They crush and destroy.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>They are unfamiliar with peace;
>Their deeds are unjust.
>They use deceitful methods,
>And whoever deals with them is unfamiliar with peace.
## Israel Confesses its Sin
###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span>For this reason deliverance is far from us
>And salvation does not reach us.
>We wait for light, but see only darkness;
>We wait for a bright light, but live in deep darkness.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>We grope along the wall like the blind,
>We grope like those who cannot see;
>We stumble at noontime as if it were evening.
>Though others are strong, we are like dead men.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>We all growl like bears,
>We coo mournfully like doves;
>We wait for deliverance, but there is none,
>For salvation, but it is far from us.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>For you are aware of our many rebellious deeds,
>And our sins testify against us;
>Indeed, we are aware of our rebellious deeds;
>We know our sins all too well.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>We have rebelled and tried to deceive the Lᴏʀᴅ;
>We turned back from following our God.
>We stir up oppression and rebellion;
>We tell lies we concocted in our minds.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>Justice is driven back;
>Godliness stands far off.
>Indeed, honesty stumbles in the city square
>And morality is not even able to enter.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>Honesty has disappeared;
>The one who tries to avoid evil is robbed.
>The Lᴏʀᴅ watches and is displeased,
>For there is no justice.
## The Lord Intervenes
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>He sees there is no advocate;
>He is shocked that no one intervenes.
>So he takes matters into his own hands;
>His desire for justice drives him on.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>He wears his desire for justice like body armor,
>And his desire to deliver is like a helmet on his head.
>He puts on the garments of vengeance
>And wears zeal like a robe.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>He repays them for what they have done,
>Dispensing angry judgment to his adversaries
>And punishing his enemies.
>He repays the coastlands.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>In the west, people respect the Lᴏʀᴅ’s reputation;
>In the east they recognize his splendor.
>For he comes like a rushing stream
>Driven on by wind sent from the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A protector comes to Zion,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To those in Jacob who repent of their rebellious deeds,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.

###### 21
<span class=verse-first>21</span>“As for me, this is my promise to them,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ. “My Spirit, who is upon you, and my words, which I have placed in your mouth, will not depart from your mouth or from the mouths of your children and descendants from this time forward,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
