## The Lᴏʀᴅ Plans to Judge the Nations
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span> For look! In those days and at that time
>I will return the exiles to Judah and Jerusalem.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Then I will gather all the nations,
>And bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat.
>I will enter into judgment against them there
>Concerning my people Israel who are my inheritance,
>Whom they scattered among the nations.
>They partitioned my land,
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>And they cast lots for my people.
>They traded a boy for a prostitute;
>They sold a little girl for wine so they could drink.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>Why are you doing these things to me, Tyre and Sidon?
>Are you trying to get even with me, land of Philistia?
>If you are, I will very quickly repay you for what you have done!
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>For you took my silver and my gold
>And brought my precious valuables to your own palaces.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>You sold Judeans and Jerusalemites to the Greeks,
>Removing them far from their own country.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Look! I am rousing them from that place to which you sold them.
>I will repay you for what you have done!
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>I will sell your sons and daughters to the people of Judah.
>They will sell them to the Sabeans, a nation far away.
>Indeed, the Lᴏʀᴅ has spoken.
## Judgment in the Valley of Jehoshaphat
###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span>Proclaim this among the nations:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Prepare for a holy war!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Call out the warriors!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let all these fighting men approach and attack!
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Beat your plowshares into swords,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And your pruning hooks into spears.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let the weak say, ‘I too am a warrior!’
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Lend your aid and come,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All you surrounding nations,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And gather yourselves to that place.”
>Bring down, O Lᴏʀᴅ, your warriors!
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let the nations be roused and let them go up
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To the Valley of Jehoshaphat,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For there I will sit in judgment on all the surrounding nations.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Rush forth with the sickle, for the harvest is ripe!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Come, stomp the grapes, for the winepress is full!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The vats overflow.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, their evil is great!”
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>Crowds, great crowds are in the Valley of Decision,
>For the day of the Lᴏʀᴅ is near in the Valley of Decision!
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>The sun and moon are darkened;
>The stars withhold their brightness.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ roars from Zion;
>From Jerusalem his voice bellows out.
>The heavens and the earth shake.
>But the Lᴏʀᴅ is a refuge for his people;
>He is a stronghold for the citizens of Israel.
## The Lord’s Presence in Zion
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will be convinced that I the Lᴏʀᴅ am your God,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Dwelling on Zion, my holy mountain.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Jerusalem will be holy—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Conquering armies will no longer pass through it.

###### 18
><span class=verse-first-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>On that day the mountains will drip with sweet wine,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the hills will flow with milk.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All the dry stream beds of Judah will flow with water.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A spring will flow out from the temple of the Lᴏʀᴅ,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Watering the Valley of Acacia Trees.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Egypt will be desolate
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And Edom will be a desolate wilderness,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because of the violence they did to the people of Judah,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In whose land they shed innocent blood.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But Judah will reside securely forever,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And Jerusalem will be secure from one generation to the next.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will avenge their blood that I had not previously acquitted.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It is the Lᴏʀᴅ who dwells in Zion!
