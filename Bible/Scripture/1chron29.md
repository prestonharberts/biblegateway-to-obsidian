## The People Contribute to the Project
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>King David said to the entire assembly: “My son Solomon, the one whom God has chosen, is just an inexperienced young man, and the task is great, for this palace is not for man, but for the Lᴏʀᴅ God.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“So I have made every effort to provide what is needed for the temple of my God, including the gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, as well as a large amount of onyx, settings of antimony and other stones, all kinds of precious stones, and alabaster.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“Now, to show my commitment to the temple of my God, I donate my personal treasure of gold and silver to the temple of my God, in addition to all that I have already supplied for this holy temple.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“This includes 3,000 talents of gold from Ophir and 7,000 talents of refined silver for overlaying the walls of the buildings,
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“for gold and silver items, and for all the work of the craftsmen. Who else wants to contribute to the Lᴏʀᴅ today?”

## David Praises the Lord
###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>David praised the Lᴏʀᴅ before the entire assembly:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

“O Lᴏʀᴅ God of our father Israel, you deserve praise forevermore!
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>“O Lᴏʀᴅ, you are great, mighty, majestic, magnificent, glorious, and sovereign over all the sky and earth! You, Lᴏʀᴅ, have dominion and exalt yourself as the ruler of all.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>“You are the source of wealth and honor; you rule over all. You possess strength and might to magnify and give strength to all.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>“Now, our God, we give thanks to you and praise your majestic name!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
<span class=verse-first>14</span>“But who am I and who are my people, that we should be in a position to contribute this much? Indeed, everything comes from you, and we have simply given back to you what is yours.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>“For we are resident foreigners and temporary settlers in your presence, as all our ancestors were; our days are like a shadow on the earth, without security.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>“O Lᴏʀᴅ our God, all this wealth, which we have collected to build a temple for you to honor your holy name, comes from you; it all belongs to you.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>“I know, my God, that you examine thoughts and are pleased with integrity. With pure motives I contribute all this; and now I look with joy as your people who have gathered here contribute to you.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>“O Lᴏʀᴅ God of our ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, always maintain these motives of your people and keep them devoted to you.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>“Make my son Solomon willing to obey your commands, rules, and regulations, and to complete building the palace for which I have made preparations.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 20
<span class=verse-first>20</span>David told the entire assembly: “Praise the Lᴏʀᴅ your God!” So the entire assembly praised the Lᴏʀᴅ God of their ancestors; they bowed down and stretched out flat on the ground before the Lᴏʀᴅ and the king.

###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>They held a feast before the Lᴏʀᴅ that day and celebrated.

###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>Solomon sat on the Lᴏʀᴅ’s throne as king in place of his father David; he was successful and all Israel was loyal to him.
###### 24
