><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ, my heart is not proud,
>Nor do I have a haughty look.
>I do not have great aspirations,
>Or concern myself with things that are beyond me.

><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Indeed, I have calmed and quieted myself
>Like a weaned child with its mother;
>I am content like a young child.

>Now and forevermore!
