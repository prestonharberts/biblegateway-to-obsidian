## The Prologue to the Gospel
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was fully God.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>The Word was with God in the beginning.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>All things were created by him, and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>In him was life, and the life was the light of mankind.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>And the light shines on in the darkness, but the darkness has not mastered it.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 6
<span class=verse-first>6</span>A man came, sent from God, whose name was John.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>He came as a witness to testify about the light, so that everyone might believe through him.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>He himself was not the light, but he came to testify about the light.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
<span class=verse-first>9</span>The true light, who gives light to everyone, was coming into the world.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>He was in the world, and the world was created by him, but the world did not recognize him.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>He came to what was his own, but his own people did not receive him.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>But to all who have received him—those who believe in his name—he has given the right to become God’s children
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>—children not born by human parents or by human desire or a husband’s decision, but by God.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
<span class=verse-first>14</span>Now the Word became flesh and took up residence among us. We saw his glory—the glory of the one and only, full of grace and truth, who came from the Father.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>John testified about him and shouted out, “This one was the one about whom I said, ‘He who comes after me is greater than I am, because he existed before me.’”
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>For we have all received from his fullness one gracious gift after another.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came about through Jesus Christ.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>No one has ever seen God. The only one, himself God, who is in closest fellowship with the Father, has made God known.
## The Testimony of John the Baptist
###### 19
<span class=verse-first>19</span>Now this was John’s testimony when the Jewish leaders sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>He confessed—he did not deny but confessed—“I am not the Christ!”
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>So they asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not!” “Are you the Prophet?” He answered, “No!”
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>Then they said to him, “Who are you? Tell us so that we can give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>John said, “I am the voice of one shouting in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way for the Lord,’ as the prophet Isaiah said.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 24
<span class=verse-first>24</span>(Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.)
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>So they asked John, “Why then are you baptizing if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>John answered them, “I baptize with water. Among you stands one whom you do not recognize,
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>“who is coming after me. I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandal!”
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>These things happened in Bethany across the Jordan River where John was baptizing.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 29
<span class=verse-first>29</span>On the next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>“This is the one about whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who is greater than I am, because he existed before me.’
###### 31
<span class=verse-body>31</span>“I did not recognize him, but I came baptizing with water so that he could be revealed to Israel.”
###### 32
<span class=verse-body>32</span>Then John testified, “I saw the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven, and it remained on him.
###### 33
<span class=verse-body>33</span>“And I did not recognize him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘The one on whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining—this is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’
###### 34
<span class=verse-body>34</span>“I have both seen and testified that this man is the Chosen One of God.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 35
<span class=verse-first>35</span>Again the next day John was standing there with two of his disciples.
###### 36
<span class=verse-body>36</span>Gazing at Jesus as he walked by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!”
###### 37
<span class=verse-body>37</span>When John’s two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.
###### 38
<span class=verse-body>38</span>Jesus turned around and saw them following and said to them, “What do you want?” So they said to him, “Rabbi” (which is translated Teacher), “where are you staying?”
###### 39
<span class=verse-body>39</span>Jesus answered, “Come and you will see.” So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. Now it was about four o’clock in the afternoon.
## Andrew’s Declaration
###### 40
<span class=verse-body>40</span>“Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two disciples who heard what John said and followed Jesus.
###### 41
<span class=verse-body>41</span>“He first found his own brother Simon and told him, “We have found the Messiah!” (which is translated Christ).
###### 42
<span class=verse-body>42</span>Andrew brought Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon, the son of John. You will be called Cephas” (which is translated Peter).
## The Calling of More Disciples
###### 43
<span class=verse-first>43</span>On the next day Jesus wanted to set out for Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, “Follow me.”
###### 44
<span class=verse-body>44</span>(Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the town of Andrew and Peter.)
###### 45
<span class=verse-body>45</span>Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the one Moses wrote about in the law, and the prophets also wrote about—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”
###### 46
<span class=verse-body>46</span>Nathanael replied, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip replied, “Come and see.”
###### 47
<span class=verse-body>47</span>Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and exclaimed, “Look, a true Israelite in whom there is no deceit!”
###### 48
<span class=verse-body>48</span>Nathanael asked him, “How do you know me?” Jesus replied, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”
###### 49
<span class=verse-body>49</span>Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the king of Israel!”
###### 50
<span class=verse-body>50</span>Jesus said to him, “Because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these.”
###### 51
<span class=verse-body>51</span>He continued, “I tell all of you the solemn truth—you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”
