><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Now, listen, Jacob my servant,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Israel whom I have chosen!”
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ, the one who made you, says—

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.
###### 3

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will pour my Spirit on your offspring
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And my blessing on your children.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will sprout up like a tree in the grass,

###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>One will say, ‘I belong to the Lᴏʀᴅ,’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And another will use the name ‘Jacob.’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>One will write on his hand, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ’s,’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And use the name ‘Israel.’”
## The Absurdity of Idolatry
###### 6
><span class=verse-first-poetry>6</span>This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ, Israel’s king, says,
>Their Protector, the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I am the first and I am the last,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There is no God but me.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who is like me? Let him make his claim!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let him announce it and explain it to me—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Since I established an ancient people—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let them announce future events.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Don’t panic! Don’t be afraid!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Did I not tell you beforehand and decree it?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You are my witnesses! Is there any God but me?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There is no other sheltering rock; I know of none.

###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All who form idols are nothing;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The things in which they delight are worthless.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their witnesses cannot see;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They recognize nothing, so they are put to shame.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who forms a god and casts an idol
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That will prove worthless?
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, all his associates will be put to shame;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The craftsmen are mere humans.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let them all assemble and take their stand.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will panic and be put to shame.

###### 12
><span class=verse-first-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A blacksmith works with his tool
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And forges metal over the coals.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He forms it with hammers;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He makes it with his strong arm.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He gets hungry and loses his energy;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He drinks no water and gets tired.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A carpenter takes measurements;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He marks out an outline of its form;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He scrapes it with chisels,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And marks it with a compass.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He patterns it after the human form,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a well-built human being,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And puts it in a shrine.
###### 14

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yes, he kindles a fire and bakes bread.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then he makes a god and worships it;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He makes an idol and bows down to it.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Half of it he burns in the fire—

><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Yes, I baked bread over the coals;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I roasted meat and ate it.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>With the rest of it should I make a disgusting idol?
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Should I bow down to dry wood?’
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He feeds on ashes;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His deceived mind misleads him.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He cannot rescue himself,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Nor does he say, ‘Is this not a false god I hold in my right hand?’
