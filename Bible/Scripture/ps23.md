###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span>Even when I must walk through the darkest valley,
>I fear no danger,
>For you are with me;
>Your rod and your staff reassure me.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>You prepare a feast before me
>In plain sight of my enemies.
>You refresh my head with oil;
>My cup is completely full.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Surely your goodness and faithfulness will pursue me all my days,
>And I will live in the Lᴏʀᴅ’s house for the rest of my life.
