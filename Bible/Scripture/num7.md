## The Leader’s Offerings
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>When Moses had completed setting up the tabernacle, he anointed it and consecrated it and all its furnishings, and he anointed and consecrated the altar and all its utensils.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of their clans, made an offering. They were the leaders of the tribes; they were the ones who had been supervising the numbering.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>They brought their offerings before the Lᴏʀᴅ, six covered carts and twelve oxen—one cart for every two of the leaders, and an ox for each one; and they presented them in front of the tabernacle.
## The Distribution of the Gifts
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>Then the Lᴏʀᴅ spoke to Moses:
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“Receive these gifts from them, that they may be used in doing the work of the tent of meeting; and you must give them to the Levites, to every man as his service requires.”
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>So Moses accepted the carts and the oxen and gave them to the Levites.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>He gave two carts and four oxen to the Gershonites, as their service required;
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>and he gave four carts and eight oxen to the Merarites, as their service required, under the authority of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>But to the Kohathites he gave none, because the service of the holy things, which they carried on their shoulders, was their responsibility.
## The Time of Presentation
###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>The leaders offered gifts for the dedication of the altar when it was anointed. And the leaders presented their offering before the altar.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ said to Moses, “They must present their offering, one leader for each day, for the dedication of the altar.”
