## Admonition to Avoid the Wiles of the Adulteress
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>My child, devote yourself to my words
>And store up my commands inside yourself.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Keep my commands so that you may live,
>And obey my instruction as your most prized possession.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Bind them on your forearm;
>Write them on the tablet of your heart.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,”
>And call understanding a close relative,
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>So that they may keep you from the adulterous woman,
>From the loose woman who has flattered you with her words.

###### 6
><span class=verse-first-poetry>6</span>For at the window of my house
>Through my window lattice I looked out
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>And I saw among the naive—
>I discerned among the youths—
>A young man who lacked sense.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>He was passing by the street near her corner,
>Making his way along the road to her house
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>In the twilight, the evening,
>In the dark of the night.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Suddenly a woman came out to meet him!
>She was dressed like a prostitute and with secret intent.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>She is loud and rebellious,
>She does not remain at home—
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>At one time outside, at another in the wide plazas,
>And by every corner she lies in wait.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>So she grabbed him and kissed him,
>And with a bold expression she said to him,
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have meat from my peace offerings at home;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Today I have fulfilled my vows!
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That is why I came out to meet you,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To look for you, and I found you!
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have spread my bed with elegant coverings,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>With richly colored fabric from Egypt.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have perfumed my bed
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Come, let’s drink deeply of lovemaking until morning,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let’s delight ourselves with love’s pleasures.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For my husband is not at home;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He has gone on a journey of some distance.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He has taken a bag of money with him;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will not return until the end of the month.”
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>She turned him aside with her persuasions;
>With her smooth talk she was enticing him along.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>Suddenly he was going after her
>Like an ox that goes to the slaughter,
>Like a stag prancing into a trapper’s snare
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span>Till an arrow pierces his liver—
>Like a bird hurrying into a trap,
>And he does not know that it will cost him his life.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 24
><span class=verse-first-poetry>24</span>So now, sons, listen to me,
>And pay attention to the words I speak.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span>Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways—
>Do not wander into her pathways;
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span>For she has brought down many fatally wounded,
>And all those she has slain are many.
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span>Her house is the way to the grave,
>Going down to the chambers of death.
