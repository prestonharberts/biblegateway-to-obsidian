## Not Everyone Enjoys Life
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Here is another misfortune that I have seen on earth,
>And it weighs heavily on people:
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>God gives a man riches, property, and wealth
>So that he lacks nothing that his heart desires,
>Yet God does not enable him to enjoy the fruit of his labor—
>Instead, someone else enjoys it!
>This is fruitless and a grave misfortune.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Even if a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years,
>Even if he lives a long, long time, but cannot enjoy his prosperity—
>Even if he were to live forever—
>I would say, “A stillborn child is better off than he is.”
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>Though the stillborn child came into the world for no reason and departed into darkness,
>Though its name is shrouded in darkness,
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Though it never saw the light of day nor knew anything,
>Yet it has more rest than that man—
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>If he should live a thousand years twice, yet does not enjoy his prosperity.
>For both of them die!

###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span>All man’s labor is for nothing more than to fill his stomach—
>Yet his appetite is never satisfied!
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>So what advantage does a wise man have over a fool?
>And what advantage does a pauper gain by knowing how to survive?
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>It is better to be content with what the eyes can see
>Than for one’s heart always to crave more.
>This continual longing is futile—like chasing the wind.
## The Futile Way Life Works
###### 10
><span class=verse-first-poetry>10</span>Whatever has happened was foreordained,
>And what happens to a person was also foreknown.
>It is useless for him to argue with God about his fate
>Because God is more powerful than he is.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>The more one argues with words, the less he accomplishes.
>How does that benefit him?
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>For no one knows what is best for a person during his life—
>During the few days of his fleeting life—
>For they pass away like a shadow.
>Nor can anyone tell him what the future will hold for him on earth.
