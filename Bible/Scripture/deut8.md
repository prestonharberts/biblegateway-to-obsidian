## The Lord’s Provision in the Desert
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>You must keep carefully all these commandments I am giving you today so that you may live, increase in number, and go in and occupy the land that the Lᴏʀᴅ promised to your ancestors.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>Remember the whole way by which he has brought you these forty years through the wilderness so that he might, by humbling you, test you to see if you have it within you to keep his commandments or not.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>So he humbled you by making you hungry and then feeding you with unfamiliar manna. He did this to teach you that humankind cannot live by bread alone, but also by everything that comes from the Lᴏʀᴅ’s mouth.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>Your clothing did not wear out nor did your feet swell all these forty years.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>Be keenly aware that just as a parent disciplines his child, so the Lᴏʀᴅ your God disciplines you.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>So you must keep his commandments, live according to his standards, and revere him.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ your God is bringing you to a good land, a land of brooks, springs, and fountains flowing forth in valleys and hills,
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>a land of wheat, barley, vines, fig trees, and pomegranates, of olive trees and honey,
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>a land where you may eat food in plenty and find no lack of anything, a land whose stones are iron and from whose hills you can mine copper.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>You will eat your fill and then praise the Lᴏʀᴅ your God because of the good land he has given you.
## Exhortation to Remember That Blessing Comes from God
###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>Be sure you do not forget the Lᴏʀᴅ your God by not keeping his commandments, ordinances, and statutes that I am giving you today.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>When you eat your fill, when you build and occupy good houses,
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>when your cattle and flocks increase, when you have plenty of silver and gold, and when you have abundance of everything,
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>be sure you do not feel self-important and forget the Lᴏʀᴅ your God who brought you from the land of Egypt, the place of slavery,
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>and who brought you through the great, fearful wilderness of venomous serpents and scorpions, an arid place with no water. He made water flow from a flint rock and
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>fed you in the wilderness with manna (which your ancestors had never before known) so that he might by humbling you test you and eventually bring good to you.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>Be careful not to say, “My own ability and skill have gotten me this wealth.”
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>You must remember the Lᴏʀᴅ your God, for he is the one who gives ability to get wealth; if you do this he will confirm his covenant that he made by oath to your ancestors, even as he has to this day.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>Now if you forget the Lᴏʀᴅ your God at all and follow other gods, worshiping and prostrating yourselves before them, I testify to you today that you will surely be annihilated.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>Just like the nations the Lᴏʀᴅ is about to destroy from your sight, so he will do to you because you would not obey him.
