## Do Not Judge
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>“Do not judge so that you will not be judged.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“For by the standard you judge you will be judged, and the measure you use will be the measure you receive.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“Why do you see the speck in your brother’s eye, but fail to see the beam of wood in your own?
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me remove the speck from your eye,’ while there is a beam in your own?
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 6
<span class=verse-first>6</span>“Do not give what is holy to dogs or throw your pearls before pigs; otherwise they will trample them under their feet and turn around and tear you to pieces.”
## Ask, Seek, Knock
###### 7
<span class=verse-first>7</span>“Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened for you.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>“For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>“Is there anyone among you who, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>“If you then, although you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 12
<span class=verse-first>12</span>“In everything, treat others as you would want them to treat you, for this fulfills the law and the prophets.”
## The Narrow Gate
###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>“Enter through the narrow gate, because the gate is wide and the way is spacious that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>“How narrow is the gate and difficult the way that leads to life, and there are few who find it!”
## A Tree and Its Fruit
###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>“Watch out for false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are voracious wolves.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>“You will recognize them by their fruit. Grapes are not gathered from thorns or figs from thistles, are they?
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>“In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>“A good tree is not able to bear bad fruit, nor a bad tree to bear good fruit.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>“Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>“So then, you will recognize them by their fruit.”
## Judgment of Pretenders
###### 21
<span class=verse-first>21</span>“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of heaven—only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>“On that day, many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, didn’t we prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many powerful deeds in your name?’
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>“Then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you. Go away from me, you lawbreakers!’”
## Hearing and Doing
###### 24
<span class=verse-first>24</span>“Everyone who hears these words of mine and does them is like a wise man who built his house on rock.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>“The rain fell, the flood came, and the winds beat against that house, but it did not collapse because its foundation had been laid on rock.
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>“Everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>“The rain fell, the flood came, and the winds beat against that house, and it collapsed—it was utterly destroyed!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 28
<span class=verse-first>28</span>When Jesus finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed by his teaching,
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>because he taught them like one who had authority, not like their experts in the law.
