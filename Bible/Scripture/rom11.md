## Israel’s Rejection not Complete nor Final
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>So I ask, God has not rejected his people, has he? Absolutely not! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew! Do you not know what the scripture says about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars; I alone am left and they are seeking my life!”
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>But what was the divine response to him? “I have kept for myself 7,000 people who have not bent the knee to Baal.”
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>So in the same way at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>And if it is by grace, it is no longer by works, otherwise grace would no longer be grace.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
<span class=verse-first>7</span>What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was diligently seeking, but the elect obtained it. The rest were hardened,
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>as it is written,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>God gave them a spirit of stupor,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To this very day.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>And David says,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let their table become a snare and trap,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A stumbling block and a retribution for them;
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let their eyes be darkened so that they may not see,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And make their backs bend continually.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>I ask then, they did not stumble into an irrevocable fall, did they? Absolutely not! But by their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make Israel jealous.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>Now if their transgression means riches for the world and their defeat means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full restoration bring?
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Seeing that I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry,
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>if somehow I could provoke my people to jealousy and save some of them.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>If the first portion of the dough offered is holy, then the whole batch is holy, and if the root is holy, so too are the branches.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
<span class=verse-first>17</span>Now if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among them and participated in the richness of the olive root,
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>do not boast over the branches. But if you boast, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>Then you will say, “The branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.”
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>Granted! They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but fear!
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>For if God did not spare the natural branches, perhaps he will not spare you.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>Notice therefore the kindness and harshness of God—harshness toward those who have fallen, but God’s kindness toward you, provided you continue in his kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>And even they—if they do not continue in their unbelief—will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree?
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 25
<span class=verse-first>25</span>For I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers and sisters, so that you may not be conceited: A partial hardening has happened to Israel until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Deliverer will come out of Zion;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will remove ungodliness from Jacob.
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And this is my covenant with them,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When I take away their sins.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>In regard to the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but in regard to election they are dearly loved for the sake of the fathers.
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable.
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>Just as you were formerly disobedient to God, but have now received mercy due to their disobedience,
###### 31
<span class=verse-body>31</span>so they too have now been disobedient in order that, by the mercy shown to you, they too may now receive mercy.
###### 32
<span class=verse-body>32</span>For God has consigned all people to disobedience so that he may show mercy to them all.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 33
<span class=verse-first>33</span>Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how unfathomable his ways!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 34
><span class=verse-body-poetry>34</span>For who has known the mind of the Lord,
>Or who has been his counselor?
###### 35
><span class=verse-body-poetry>35</span>Or who has first given to God,
>That God needs to repay him?
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 36
<span class=verse-body>36</span>For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever! Amen.
