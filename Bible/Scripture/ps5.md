###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Listen to what I say, Lᴏʀᴅ!

###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Lᴏʀᴅ, in the morning you will hear me;

<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span>Certainly you are not a God who approves of evil;
>Evil people cannot dwell with you.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Arrogant people cannot stand in your presence;

###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>You destroy liars;
>The Lᴏʀᴅ despises violent and deceitful people.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>But as for me, because of your great faithfulness I will enter your house;

>Their throats like an open grave,
>Their tongues like a steep slope leading into it.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Condemn them, O God!

>Shelter them so that those who are loyal to you may rejoice.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Certainly you reward the godly, Lᴏʀᴅ.
>Like a shield you protect them in your good favor.
