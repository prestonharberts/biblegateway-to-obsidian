## Israel’s Rejection Considered
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>I am telling the truth in Christ (I am not lying!), for my conscience assures me in the Holy Spirit—
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>For I could wish that I myself were accursed—cut off from Christ—for the sake of my people, my fellow countrymen,
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>who are Israelites. To them belong the adoption as sons, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the temple worship, and the promises.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>To them belong the patriarchs, and from them, by human descent, came the Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever! Amen.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 6
<span class=verse-first>6</span>It is not as though the word of God had failed. For not all those who are descended from Israel are truly Israel,
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>nor are all the children Abraham’s true descendants; rather “through Isaac will your descendants be counted.”
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>This means it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God; rather, the children of promise are counted as descendants.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>For this is what the promise declared: “About a year from now I will return and Sarah will have a son.”
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>Not only that, but when Rebekah had conceived children by one man, our ancestor Isaac—
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>even before they were born or had done anything good or bad (so that God’s purpose in election would stand, not by works but by his calling)—
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>it was said to her, “The older will serve the younger,”
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>just as it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
<span class=verse-first>14</span>What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? Absolutely not!
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>For he says to Moses: “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>So then, it does not depend on human desire or exertion, but on God who shows mercy.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>For the scripture says to Pharaoh: “For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I may demonstrate my power in you, and that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth.”
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>So then, God has mercy on whom he chooses to have mercy, and he hardens whom he chooses to harden.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 19
<span class=verse-first>19</span>You will say to me then, “Why does he still find fault? For who has ever resisted his will?”
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>But who indeed are you—a mere human being—to talk back to God? Does what is molded say to the molder, “Why have you made me like this?”
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>Has the potter no right to make from the same lump of clay one vessel for special use and another for ordinary use?
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>But what if God, willing to demonstrate his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience the objects of wrath prepared for destruction?
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>And what if he is willing to make known the wealth of his glory on the objects of mercy that he has prepared beforehand for glory—
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>even us, whom he has called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>As he also says in Hosea:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will call those who were not my people, ‘My people,’ and I will call her who was unloved, ‘My beloved.’”
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And in the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 27
<span class=verse-first>27</span>And Isaiah cries out on behalf of Israel, “Though the number of the children of Israel are as the sand of the sea, only the remnant will be saved,
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>“for the Lord will execute his sentence on the earth completely and quickly.”
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>Just as Isaiah predicted,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If the Lord of Heaven’s Armies had not left us descendants,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We would have become like Sodom,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And we would have resembled Gomorrah.”
## Israel’s Rejection Culpable
###### 30
<span class=verse-first>30</span>What shall we say then?—that the Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness obtained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith,
###### 31
<span class=verse-body>31</span>but Israel even though pursuing a law of righteousness did not attain it.
###### 32
<span class=verse-body>32</span>Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but (as if it were possible) by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone,
###### 33
<span class=verse-body>33</span>just as it is written,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, I am laying in Zion a stone that will cause people to stumble
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And a rock that will make them fall,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yet the one who believes in him will not be put to shame.”
