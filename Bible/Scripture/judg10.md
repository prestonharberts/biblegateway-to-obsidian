###### 3
<span class=verse-first>3</span>Jair the Gileadite rose up after him; he led Israel for twenty-two years.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys and possessed thirty cities. To this day these towns are called Havvoth Jair—they are in the land of Gilead.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>Jair died and was buried in Kamon.
## The Lord’s Patience Runs Short
###### 6
<span class=verse-first>6</span>The Israelites again did evil in the Lᴏʀᴅ’s sight. They worshiped the Baals and the Ashtoreths, as well as the gods of Syria, Sidon, Moab, the Ammonites, and the Philistines. They abandoned the Lᴏʀᴅ and did not worship him.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ was furious with Israel and turned them over to the Philistines and Ammonites.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>They ruthlessly oppressed the Israelites that eighteenth year—that is, all the Israelites living east of the Jordan in Amorite country in Gilead.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>The Ammonites crossed the Jordan to fight with Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim. Israel suffered greatly.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>The Israelites cried out for help to the Lᴏʀᴅ: “We have sinned against you. We abandoned our God and worshiped the Baals.”
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said to the Israelites, “Did I not deliver you from Egypt, the Amorites, the Ammonites, the Philistines,
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>“the Sidonians, Amalek, and Midian when they oppressed you? You cried out for help to me, and I delivered you from their power.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>“But since you abandoned me and worshiped other gods, I will not deliver you again.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>“Go and cry for help to the gods you have chosen! Let them deliver you from trouble!”
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>But the Israelites said to the Lᴏʀᴅ, “We have sinned. You do to us as you see fit, but deliver us today!”
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>They threw away the foreign gods they owned and worshiped the Lᴏʀᴅ. Finally the Lᴏʀᴅ grew tired of seeing Israel suffer so much.
## An Outcast Becomes a General
###### 17
<span class=verse-first>17</span>The Ammonites assembled and camped in Gilead; the Israelites gathered together and camped in Mizpah.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>The leaders of Gilead said to one another, “Who is willing to lead the charge against the Ammonites? He will become the leader of all who live in Gilead!”
