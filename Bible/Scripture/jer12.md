## Jeremiah Appeals to God
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Lᴏʀᴅ, you have always been fair
>Whenever I have complained to you.
>However, I would like to speak with you about the disposition of justice.
>Why are wicked people successful?
>Why do all dishonest people have such easy lives?
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>You plant them like trees and they put down their roots.
>They grow prosperous and are very fruitful.

>But they really care nothing about you.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>But you, Lᴏʀᴅ, know all about me.
>You watch me and test my devotion to you.
>Drag these wicked men away like sheep to be slaughtered!
>Appoint a time when they will be killed!
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>How long must the land be parched
>And the grass in every field be withered?
>How long must the animals and the birds die
>Because of the wickedness of the people who live in this land?
>For these people boast,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>God will not see what happens to us.”

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If you have raced on foot against men and they have worn you out,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How will you be able to compete with horses?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And if you feel secure only in safe and open country,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How will you manage in the thick undergrowth along the Jordan River?
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As a matter of fact, even your own brothers
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the members of your own family have betrayed you as well.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even they have plotted to do away with you.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So do not trust them even when they say kind things to you.

###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The people I call my own attack me like birds of prey or like hyenas.

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let all the nations gather together like wild beasts.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let them come and destroy these people I call my own.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Many foreign rulers will ruin the land where I planted my people.

###### 14
<span class=verse-first>14</span>“I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, also have something to say concerning the wicked nations who surround my land and have attacked and plundered the land that I gave to my people as a permanent possession. I say: ‘I will uproot the people of those nations from their land and I will free the people of Judah who have been taken there.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>‘But after I have uprooted the people of those nations, I will relent and have pity on them. I will restore the people of each of those nations to their own lands and to their own country.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>‘But they must make sure to learn to follow the religious practices of my people. Once they taught my people to swear their oaths using the name of the god Baal. But then, they must swear oaths using my name, saying, “As surely as the Lᴏʀᴅ lives, I swear.” If they do these things, then they will be included among the people I call my own.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>‘But I will completely uproot and destroy any of those nations that will not pay heed,’” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
