## Nebuchadnezzar Dreams of a Tree Chopped Down
###### 4
<span class=verse-first>4</span> I, Nebuchadnezzar, was relaxing in my home, living luxuriously in my palace.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>I saw a dream that frightened me badly. The things I imagined while lying on my bed—these visions of my mind—were terrifying me.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>So I issued an order for all the wise men of Babylon to be brought before me so that they could make known to me the interpretation of the dream.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>When the magicians, astrologers, wise men, and diviners entered, I recounted the dream for them. But they were unable to make known its interpretation to me.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>Later Daniel entered (whose name is Belteshazzar after the name of my god, and in whom there is a spirit of the holy gods). I recounted the dream for him as well,
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>saying, “Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, in whom I know there to be a spirit of the holy gods and whom no mystery baffles, consider my dream that I saw and set forth its interpretation!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>“Here are the visions of my mind while I was on my bed.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>While I was watching,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There was a tree in the middle of the land.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It was enormously tall.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The tree grew large and strong.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Its top reached far into the sky;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It could be seen from the borders of all the land.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Its foliage was attractive and its fruit plentiful;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>On it there was food enough for all.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Under it the wild animals used to seek shade,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And in its branches the birds of the sky used to nest.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All creatures used to feed themselves from it.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>While I was watching in my mind’s visions on my bed,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A holy sentinel came down from heaven.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He called out loudly as follows:
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Chop down the tree and lop off its branches!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Strip off its foliage
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And scatter its fruit!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Let the animals flee from under it
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And the birds from its branches.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>But leave its taproot in the ground,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>With a band of iron and bronze around it
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Surrounded by the grass of the field.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Let it become damp with the dew of the sky,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And let it live with the animals in the grass of the land.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Let his mind be altered from that of a human being,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And let an animal’s mind be given to him,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And let seven periods of time go by for him.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>This announcement is by the decree of the sentinels;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>This decision is by the pronouncement of the holy ones,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>So that those who are alive may understand
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>That the Most High has authority over human kingdoms,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And he bestows them on whomever he wishes.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He establishes over them even the lowliest of human beings.’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>“This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw. Now you, Belteshazzar, declare its interpretation, for none of the wise men in my kingdom are able to make known to me the interpretation. But you can do so, for a spirit of the holy gods is in you.”
## Daniel Interprets Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream
###### 19
<span class=verse-first>19</span>Then Daniel (whose name is also Belteshazzar) was upset for a brief time; his thoughts were alarming him. The king said, “Belteshazzar, don’t let the dream and its interpretation alarm you.” But Belteshazzar replied, “Sir, if only the dream were for your enemies and its interpretation applied to your adversaries!
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>“The tree that you saw that grew large and strong, whose top reached to the sky, and that could be seen in all the land,
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>whose foliage was attractive and its fruit plentiful, and from which there was food available for all, under whose branches wild animals used to live, and in whose branches birds of the sky used to nest—
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>it is you, O king! For you have become great and strong. Your greatness is such that it reaches to heaven, and your authority to the ends of the earth.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>As for the king seeing a holy sentinel coming down from heaven and saying, ‘Chop down the tree and destroy it, but leave its taproot in the ground, with a band of iron and bronze around it, surrounded by the grass of the field. Let it become damp with the dew of the sky, and let it live with the wild animals, until seven periods of time go by for him’—
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>“this is the interpretation, O king. It is the decision of the Most High that this has happened to my lord the king.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>“You will be driven from human society, and you will live with the wild animals. You will be fed grass like oxen, and you will become damp with the dew of the sky. Seven periods of time will pass by for you, before you understand that the Most High is ruler over human kingdoms and gives them to whomever he wishes.
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>“They said to leave the taproot of the tree, for your kingdom will be restored to you when you come to understand that heaven rules.
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>“Therefore, O king, may my advice be pleasing to you. Break away from your sins by doing what is right, and from your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor. Perhaps your prosperity will be prolonged.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 28
<span class=verse-first>28</span>Now all this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>After twelve months, he happened to be walking around on the battlements of the royal palace of Babylon.
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>The king uttered these words: “Is this not the great Babylon that I have built for a royal residence by my own mighty strength and for my majestic honor?”
###### 31
<span class=verse-body>31</span>While these words were still on the king’s lips, a voice came down from heaven: “It is hereby announced to you, King Nebuchadnezzar, that your kingdom has been removed from you!
###### 32
<span class=verse-body>32</span>“You will be driven from human society, and you will live with the wild animals. You will be fed grass like oxen, and seven periods of time will pass by for you before you understand that the Most High is ruler over human kingdoms and gives them to whomever he wishes.”
###### 33
<span class=verse-body>33</span>Now in that very moment this pronouncement about Nebuchadnezzar came true. He was driven from human society, he ate grass like oxen, and his body became damp with the dew of the sky, until his hair became long like an eagle’s feathers, and his nails like a bird’s claws.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 34
<span class=verse-first>34</span>But at the end of the appointed time I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up toward heaven, and my sanity returned to me.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

>I extolled the Most High,
>And I praised and glorified the one who lives forever.
>For his authority is an everlasting authority,
>And his kingdom extends from one generation to the next.
###### 35
><span class=verse-body-poetry>35</span>All the inhabitants of the earth are regarded as nothing.
>He does as he wishes with the army of heaven
>And with those who inhabit the earth.
>No one slaps his hand
>And says to him, ‘What have you done?’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 36
<span class=verse-body>36</span>“At that time my sanity returned to me. I was restored to the honor of my kingdom, and my splendor returned to me. My ministers and my nobles were seeking me out, and I was reinstated over my kingdom. I became even greater than before.
###### 37
<span class=verse-body>37</span>“Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven, for all his deeds are right and his ways are just. He is able to bring down those who live in pride.
