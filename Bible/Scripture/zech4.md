## Vision Five: The Menorah
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The angelic messenger who had been speaking with me then returned and woke me, as a person is wakened from sleep.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>He asked me, “What do you see?” I replied, “I see a menorah of pure gold with a receptacle at the top. There are seven lamps at the top, with seven pipes going to the lamps.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“There are also two olive trees beside it, one on the right of the receptacle and the other on the left.”
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>Then I asked the messenger who spoke with me, “What are these, sir?”
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>He replied, “Don’t you know what these are?” So I responded, “No, sir.”
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>Therefore he told me, “This is the Lᴏʀᴅ’s message to Zerubbabel: ‘Not by strength and not by power, but by my Spirit,’ says the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies.”
## Oracle of Response
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“What are you, you great mountain? Because of Zerubbabel you will become a level plain! And he will bring forth the temple capstone with shoutings of ‘Grace! Grace!’ because of this.”

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>Moreover, the Lᴏʀᴅ’s message came to me as follows:
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>“The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundations of this temple, and his hands will complete it. Then you will know that the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies has sent me to you.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“For who dares make light of small beginnings? These seven eyes will joyfully look on the tin tablet in Zerubbabel’s hand. These are the eyes of the Lᴏʀᴅ, which constantly range across the whole earth.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>Next I asked the messenger, “What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the menorah?”
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>Before he could reply I asked again, “What are these two extensions of the olive trees, which are emptying out the golden oil through the two golden pipes?”
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>He replied, “Don’t you know what these are?” And I said, “No, sir.”
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>So he said, “These are the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord of the whole earth.”
