###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ, for David’s sake remember
>All his strenuous effort,
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>And how he made a vow to the Lᴏʀᴅ,
>And swore an oath to the Powerful One of Jacob.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>He said, “I will not enter my own home,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or get into my bed.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will not allow my eyes to sleep,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or my eyelids to slumber,
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Until I find a place for the Lᴏʀᴅ,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A fine dwelling place for the Powerful One of Jacob.”

###### 6
><span class=verse-first-poetry>6</span>Look, we heard about it in Ephrathah;
>We found it in the territory of Jaar.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Let us go to his dwelling place.
>Let us worship before his footstool.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Ascend, O Lᴏʀᴅ, to your resting place,
>You and the ark of your strength.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>May your priests be clothed with integrity.
>May your loyal followers shout for joy.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
><span class=verse-first-poetry>10</span>For the sake of David, your servant,
>Do not reject your chosen king.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ made a reliable promise to David;
>He will not go back on his word.
>He said, “I will place one of your descendants on your throne.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If your sons keep my covenant
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the rules I teach them,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their sons will also sit on your throne forever.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span>Certainly the Lᴏʀᴅ has chosen Zion;
>He decided to make it his home.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>He said, “This will be my resting place forever;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will live here, for I have chosen it.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will abundantly supply what she needs;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will give her poor all the food they need.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will protect her priests,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And her godly people will shout exuberantly.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There I will make David strong;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have determined that my chosen king’s dynasty will continue.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will humiliate his enemies,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And his crown will shine.”
