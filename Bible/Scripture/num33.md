###### 52
<span class=verse-body>52</span>‘you must drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you. Destroy all their carved images, all their molten images, and demolish their high places.
###### 53
<span class=verse-body>53</span>‘You must dispossess the inhabitants of the land and live in it, for I have given you the land to possess it.
###### 54
<span class=verse-body>54</span>‘You must divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families.

You must inherit according to your ancestral tribes.
###### 55
<span class=verse-body>55</span>‘But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land before you, then those whom you allow to remain will be irritants in your eyes and thorns in your side, and will cause you trouble in the land where you will be living.
