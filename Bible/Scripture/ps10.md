>Do not forget the oppressed.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>Why does the wicked man reject God?
>He says to himself, “You will not hold me accountable.”
###### 14

>The nations are driven out of his land.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>Lᴏʀᴅ, you have heard the request of the oppressed;
>You make them feel secure because you listen to their prayer.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>You defend the fatherless and oppressed,
>So that mere mortals may no longer terrorize them.
