###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span> Abijah passed away and was buried in the City of David. His son Asa replaced him as king. During his reign the land had rest for ten years.
## Asa’s Religious and Military Accomplishments
###### 2
<span class=verse-first>2</span> Asa did what the Lᴏʀᴅ his God desired and approved.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>He removed the pagan altars and the high places, smashed the sacred pillars, and cut down the Asherah poles.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>He ordered Judah to seek the Lᴏʀᴅ God of their ancestors and to observe his law and commands.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>He removed the high places and the incense altars from all the towns of Judah. The kingdom had rest under his rule.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>He built fortified cities throughout Judah, for the land was at rest and there was no war during those years; the Lᴏʀᴅ gave him peace.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>He said to the people of Judah: “Let’s build these cities and fortify them with walls, towers, and barred gates. The land remains ours because we have followed the Lᴏʀᴅ our God; we have followed him, and he has made us secure on all sides.” So they built the cities and prospered.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>Asa had an army of 300,000 men from Judah, equipped with large shields and spears. He also had 280,000 men from Benjamin who carried small shields and were adept archers; they were all skilled warriors.

###### 9
<span class=verse-first>9</span>Zerah the Cushite marched against them with an army of 1,000,000 men and 300 chariots. He arrived at Mareshah,
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>and Asa went out to oppose him. They deployed for battle in the Valley of Zephathah near Mareshah.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>Asa prayed to the Lᴏʀᴅ his God: “O Lᴏʀᴅ, there is no one but you who can help the weak when they are vastly outnumbered. Help us, O Lᴏʀᴅ our God, for we rely on you and have marched on your behalf against this huge army. O Lᴏʀᴅ, you are our God; don’t let men prevail against you!”
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ struck down the Cushites before Asa and Judah. The Cushites fled,
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>and Asa and his army chased them as far as Gerar. The Cushites were wiped out; they were shattered before the Lᴏʀᴅ and his army. The men of Judah carried off a huge amount of plunder.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>They defeated all the towns surrounding Gerar, for the Lᴏʀᴅ caused them to panic. The men of Judah looted all the towns, for they contained a huge amount of goods.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>They also attacked the tents of the herdsmen in charge of the livestock. They carried off many sheep and camels and then returned to Jerusalem.
