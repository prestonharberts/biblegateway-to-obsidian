###### 3
><span class=verse-first-poetry>3</span>When I refused to confess my sin,
>My whole body wasted away,
>While I groaned in pain all day long.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>For day and night you tormented me;
>You tried to destroy me in the intense heat of summer. (Selah)
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Then I confessed my sin;
>I no longer covered up my wrongdoing.
>I said, “I will confess my rebellious acts to the Lᴏʀᴅ.”
>And then you forgave my sins. (Selah)
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>For this reason every one of your faithful followers should pray to you
>While there is a window of opportunity.
>Certainly when the surging water rises,
>It will not reach them.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>You are my hiding place;
>You protect me from distress.
>You surround me with shouts of joy from those celebrating deliverance. (Selah)

><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span>I will instruct and teach you about how you should live.
>I will advise you as I look you in the eye.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>Do not be like an unintelligent horse or mule,
>Which will not obey you
>Unless they are controlled by a bridle and bit.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>An evil person suffers much pain,
>But the Lᴏʀᴅ’s faithfulness overwhelms the one who trusts in him.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Rejoice in the Lᴏʀᴅ and be happy, you who are godly!
>Shout for joy, all you who are morally upright!
