## The Locusts’ Devastation
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Blow the trumpet in Zion;
>Sound the alarm signal on my holy mountain!
>Let all the inhabitants of the land shake with fear,
>For the day of the Lᴏʀᴅ is about to come.
>Indeed, it is near!
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>It will be a day of dreadful darkness,
>A day of foreboding storm clouds,
>Like blackness spread over the mountains.
>It is a huge and powerful army—
>There has never been anything like it ever before,
>And there will not be anything like it for many generations to come!
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Like fire they devour everything in their path;
>A flame blazes behind them.
>The land looks like the Garden of Eden before them,
>But behind them there is only a desolate wilderness—
>For nothing escapes them!
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>They look like horses;
>They charge ahead like war horses.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>They sound like chariots rumbling over mountain tops,
>Like the crackling of blazing fire consuming stubble,
>Like the noise of a mighty army being drawn up for battle.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>People writhe in fear when they see them.
>All their faces turn pale with fright.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>They charge like warriors;
>They scale walls like soldiers.
>Each one proceeds on his course;
>They do not alter their path.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>They do not jostle one another;
>Each of them marches straight ahead.
>They burst through the city defenses
>And do not break ranks.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>They rush into the city;
>They scale its walls.
>They climb up into the houses;
>They go in through the windows like a thief.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>The earth quakes before them;
>The sky reverberates.
>The sun and the moon grow dark;
>The stars refuse to shine.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>The voice of the Lᴏʀᴅ thunders as he leads his army.
>Indeed, his warriors are innumerable;
>Surely his command is carried out!
>Yes, the day of the Lᴏʀᴅ is awesome
>And very terrifying—who can survive it?
## An Appeal for Repentance
###### 12
><span class=verse-first-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yet even now,” the Lᴏʀᴅ says,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Return to me with all your heart—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>With fasting, weeping, and mourning.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Tear your hearts,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Not just your garments.”
>Return to the Lᴏʀᴅ your God,
>For he is merciful and compassionate,
>Slow to anger and boundless in loyal love—often relenting from calamitous punishment.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>Who knows?
>Perhaps he will be compassionate and grant a reprieve,
>And leave blessing in his wake—
>A meal offering and a drink offering for you to offer to the Lᴏʀᴅ your God!
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>Blow the trumpet in Zion.
>Announce a holy fast;
>Proclaim a sacred assembly.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>Gather the people;
>Sanctify an assembly!
>Gather the elders;
>Gather the children and the nursing infants.
>Let the bridegroom come out from his bedroom
>And the bride from her private quarters.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>Let the priests, those who serve the Lᴏʀᴅ, weep
>From the vestibule all the way back to the altar.
>Let them say, “Have pity, O Lᴏʀᴅ, on your people;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Please do not turn over your inheritance to be mocked,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To become a proverb among the nations.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why should it be said among the peoples,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Where is their God?’
## The Lᴏʀᴅ’s Response
###### 18
><span class=verse-first-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then the Lᴏʀᴅ became zealous for his land;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He had compassion on his people.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ responded to his people,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look! I am about to restore your grain
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>As well as fresh wine and olive oil.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will be fully satisfied.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will never again make you an object of mockery among the nations.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will remove the one from the north far from you.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will drive him out to a dry and desolate place.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Those in front will be driven eastward into the Dead Sea,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And those in back westward into the Mediterranean Sea.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His stench will rise up as a foul smell.”
>Indeed, the Lᴏʀᴅ has accomplished great things!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 21
><span class=verse-first-poetry>21</span>Do not fear, my land.
>Rejoice and be glad,
>Because the Lᴏʀᴅ has accomplished great things!
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>Do not fear, wild animals.
>For the pastures of the wilderness are again green with grass.
>Indeed, the trees bear their fruit;
>The fig tree and the vine yield to their fullest.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span>Citizens of Zion, rejoice!
>Be glad because of what the Lᴏʀᴅ your God has done!
>For he has given to you the early rains as vindication.
>He has sent to you the rains—
>Both the early and the late rains as formerly.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span>The threshing floors are full of grain;
>The vats overflow with fresh wine and olive oil.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span>I will make up for the years
>That the ‘arbeh-locust consumed your crops—
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The yeleq-locust, the hasil-locust, and the gazam-locust—
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>My great army that I sent against you.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You will have plenty to eat,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And your hunger will be fully satisfied;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You will praise the name of the Lᴏʀᴅ your God,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Who has acted wondrously in your behalf.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>My people will never again be put to shame.
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You will be convinced that I am in the midst of Israel.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I am the Lᴏʀᴅ your God; there is no other.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>My people will never again be put to shame.

###### 28
><span class=verse-first-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>3:
‘## 1 After all of this
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will pour out my Spirit on all kinds of people.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Your sons and daughters will prophesy.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Your elderly will have prophetic dreams;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Your young men will see visions.
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Even on male and female servants
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will pour out my Spirit in those days.
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will produce portents both in the sky and on the earth—
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Blood, fire, and columns of smoke.
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The sunlight will be turned to darkness
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And the moon to the color of blood,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Before the day of the Lᴏʀᴅ comes—
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>That great and terrible day!
###### 32
><span class=verse-body-poetry>32</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>It will so happen that
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Everyone who calls on the name of the Lᴏʀᴅ will be delivered.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who survive,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Just as the Lᴏʀᴅ has promised;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The remnant will be those whom the Lᴏʀᴅ will call.
