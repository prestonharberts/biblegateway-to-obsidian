###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>One dead fly makes the perfumer’s ointment give off a rancid stench,
>So a little folly can outweigh much wisdom.
## Wisdom Can Be Nullified By the Caprice of Rulers
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>A wise person’s good sense protects him,
>But a fool’s lack of sense leaves him vulnerable.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Even when a fool walks along the road he lacks sense,
>And shows everyone what a fool he is.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>If the anger of the ruler flares up against you, do not resign from your position,
>For a calm response can undo great offenses.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 5
><span class=verse-first-poetry>5</span>I have seen another misfortune on the earth:
>It is an error a ruler makes.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Fools are placed in many positions of authority,
>While wealthy men sit in lowly positions.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>I have seen slaves on horseback
>And princes walking on foot like slaves.
## Wisdom is Needed to Avert Dangers in Everyday Life
###### 8
><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span>One who digs a pit may fall into it,
>And one who breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>One who quarries stones may be injured by them;
>One who splits logs may be endangered by them.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>If an iron axhead is blunt and a workman does not sharpen its edge,
>He must exert a great deal of effort;
>So wisdom has the advantage of giving success.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>If the snake should bite before it is charmed,
>The snake charmer is in trouble.
## Words and Works of Wise Men and Fools
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>The words of a wise person win him favor,
>But the words of a fool are self-destructive.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>At the beginning his words are foolish
>And at the end his talk is wicked madness,
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>Yet a fool keeps on babbling.
>No one knows what will happen;
>Who can tell him what will happen in the future?
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>The toil of a stupid fool wears him out,
>Because he does not even know the way to the city.
## The Problem with Foolish Rulers
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>Woe to you, O land, when your king is childish,
>And your princes feast in the morning.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>Blessed are you, O land, when your king is the son of nobility,
>And your princes feast at the proper time—with self-control and not in drunkenness.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>Because of laziness the roof caves in,
>And because of idle hands the house leaks.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>Feasts are made for laughter,
>And wine makes life merry,
>But money is the answer for everything.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>Do not curse a king even in your thoughts,
>And do not curse the rich while in your bedroom;
>For a bird might report what you are thinking,
>Or some winged creature might repeat your words.
