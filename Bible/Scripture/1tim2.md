## Prayer for All People
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>First of all, then, I urge that requests, prayers, intercessions, and thanks be offered on behalf of all people,
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>even for kings and all who are in authority, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>Such prayer for all is good and welcomed before God our Savior,
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>since he wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>For there is one God and one intermediary between God and humanity, Christ Jesus, himself human,
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>who gave himself as a ransom for all, revealing God’s purpose at his appointed time.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>For this I was appointed a preacher and apostle—I am telling the truth; I am not lying—and a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>So I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or dispute.
## Conduct of Women
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>Likewise the women are to dress in suitable apparel, with modesty and self-control. Their adornment must not be with braided hair and gold or pearls or expensive clothing,
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>but with good deeds, as is proper for women who profess reverence for God.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>A woman must learn quietly with all submissiveness.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man. She must remain quiet.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>For Adam was formed first and then Eve.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>And Adam was not deceived, but the woman, because she was fully deceived, fell into transgression.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>But she will be delivered through childbearing, if she continues in faith and love and holiness with self-control.
