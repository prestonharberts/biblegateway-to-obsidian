## The Boiling Pot
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Lord’s message came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month:
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“Son of man, write down the name of this day, this very day. The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“Recite a proverb to this rebellious house and say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>‘Set on the pot, set it on,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Pour water in it too;
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Add the pieces of meat to it,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Every good piece,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The thigh and the shoulder;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Fill it with choice bones.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Take the choice bone of the flock,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Heap up wood under it;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Boil rapidly,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And boil its bones in it.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 6
<span class=verse-first>6</span>“‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Woe to the city of bloodshed,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The pot whose rot is in it,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Whose rot has not been removed from it!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Empty it piece by piece.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>No lot has fallen on it.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For her blood was in it;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>She poured it on an exposed rock;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>She did not pour it on the ground to cover it up with dust.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>To arouse anger, to take vengeance,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I have placed her blood on an exposed rock so that it cannot be covered up.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>“‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Woe to the city of bloodshed!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will also make the pile high.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Pile up the wood, kindle the fire;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Cook the meat well, mix in the spices,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Let the bones be charred.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Set the empty pot on the coals,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Until it becomes hot and its copper glows,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Until its uncleanness melts within it and its rot is consumed.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>It has tried my patience;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Yet its thick rot is not removed from it.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Subject its rot to the fire!
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You mix uncleanness with obscene conduct.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I tried to cleanse you, but you are not clean.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You will not be cleansed from your uncleanness
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Until I have exhausted my anger on you.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>“‘I the Lᴏʀᴅ have spoken; judgment is coming and I will act! I will not relent, or show pity, or be sorry! I will judge you according to your conduct and your deeds, declares the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ.’”
## Ezekiel’s Wife Dies
###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>The Lord’s message came to me:
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>“Son of man, realize that I am about to take the delight of your eyes away from you with a jolt, but you must not mourn or weep or shed tears.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>“Groan to moan for the dead, but do not perform mourning rites. Bind on your turban and put your sandals on your feet. Do not cover your lip and do not eat food brought by others.”
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>So I spoke to the people in the morning, and my wife died in the evening. In the morning I acted just as I was commanded.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>Then the people said to me, “Will you not tell us what these things you are doing mean for us?”
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>So I said to them: “The Lord’s message came to me:
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>“Say to the house of Israel, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says: Realize I am about to desecrate my sanctuary—the source of your confident pride, the object in which your eyes delight, and your life’s passion. Your very own sons and daughters whom you have left behind will die by the sword.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>‘Then you will do as I have done: You will not cover your lip or eat food brought by others.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>‘Your turbans will be on your heads and your sandals on your feet; you will not mourn or weep, but you will rot for your iniquities and groan among yourselves.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>‘Ezekiel will be an object lesson for you; you will do all that he has done. When it happens, then you will know that I am the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ.’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 25
<span class=verse-first>25</span>“And you, son of man, this is what will happen on the day I take from them their stronghold—their beautiful source of joy, the object in which their eyes delight, and the main concern of their lives, as well as their sons and daughters:
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>“On that day a fugitive will come to you to report the news.
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>“On that day you will be able to speak again; you will talk with the fugitive and be silent no longer. You will be an object lesson for them, and they will know that I am the Lᴏʀᴅ.”
