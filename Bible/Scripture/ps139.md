###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ, you examine me and know me.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>You know when I sit down and when I get up;
>Even from far away you understand my motives.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>You carefully observe me when I travel or when I lie down to rest;
>You are aware of everything I do.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>Certainly my tongue does not frame a word
>Without you, O Lᴏʀᴅ, being thoroughly aware of it.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>You squeeze me in from behind and in front;
>You place your hand on me.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Your knowledge is beyond my comprehension;
>It is so far beyond me, I am unable to fathom it.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span>Where can I go to escape your Spirit?
>Where can I flee to escape your presence?
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>If I were to ascend to heaven, you would be there.
>If I were to sprawl out in Sheol, there you would be.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>If I were to fly away on the wings of the dawn,
>And settle down on the other side of the sea,
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Even there your hand would guide me,
>Your right hand would grab hold of me.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>If I were to say, “Certainly the darkness will cover me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the light will turn to night all around me,”
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Even the darkness is not too dark for you to see,
>And the night is as bright as day;
>Darkness and light are the same to you.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span>Certainly you made my mind and heart;
>You wove me together in my mother’s womb.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>I will give you thanks because your deeds are awesome and amazing.
>You knew me thoroughly;
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>My bones were not hidden from you,
>When I was made in secret
>And sewed together in the depths of the earth.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>Your eyes saw me when I was inside the womb.
>All the days ordained for me
>Were recorded in your scroll
>Before one of them came into existence.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
><span class=verse-first-poetry>17</span>How difficult it is for me to fathom your thoughts about me, O God!
>How vast is their sum total.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>If I tried to count them,
>They would outnumber the grains of sand.
>Even if I finished counting them,
>I would still have to contend with you.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 19
><span class=verse-first-poetry>19</span>If only you would kill the wicked, O God!
>Get away from me, you violent men!
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>They rebel against you and act deceitfully;
>Your enemies lie.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ, do I not hate those who hate you,
>And despise those who oppose you?
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>I absolutely hate them;
>They have become my enemies.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 23
><span class=verse-first-poetry>23</span>Examine me, O God, and probe my thoughts.
>Test me, and know my concerns.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span>See if there is any idolatrous way in me,
>And lead me in the everlasting way.
