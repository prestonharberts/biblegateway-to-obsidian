## A Coming Leadership Crisis
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Look, the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies
>Is about to remove from Jerusalem and Judah
>Every source of security, including
>All the food and water,
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>The mighty men and warriors,
>Judges and prophets,
>Omen readers and leaders,
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Captains of groups of fifty,
>The respected citizens,
>Advisers and those skilled in magical arts,
>And those who know incantations.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ says, “I will make youths their officials;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Malicious young men will rule over them.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The people will treat each other harshly;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Men will oppose each other;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Neighbors will fight.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Youths will proudly defy the elderly
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And riffraff will challenge those who were once respected.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, a man will grab his brother
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Right in his father’s house and say,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You own a coat—
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You be our leader!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>This heap of ruins will be under your control.’
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>At that time the brother will shout,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I am no doctor,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I have no food or coat in my house;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Don’t make me a leader of the people!’”
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Jerusalem certainly stumbles,
>Judah falls,
>For their words and their actions offend the Lᴏʀᴅ;
>They rebel against his royal authority.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>The look on their faces testifies to their guilt;
>Like the people of Sodom they openly boast of their sin.
>Woe to them!
>For they bring disaster on themselves.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Tell the innocent it will go well with them,
>For they will be rewarded for what they have done.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Woe to the wicked sinners!
>For they will get exactly what they deserve.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Oppressors treat my people cruelly;
>Creditors rule over them.
>My people, your leaders mislead you;
>They give you confusing directions.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ takes his position to judge;
>He stands up to pass sentence on his people.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ comes to pronounce judgment
>On the leaders of his people and their officials.
>He says, “It is you who have ruined the vineyard!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You have stashed in your houses what you have stolen from the poor.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why do you crush my people
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And grind the faces of the poor?”
>The Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies has spoken.
## Washing Away Impurity
###### 16
><span class=verse-first-poetry>16</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ says,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The women of Zion are proud.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They walk with their heads high
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And flirt with their eyes.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They skip along
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the jewelry on their ankles jingles.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So the Lord will afflict the foreheads of Zion’s women with skin diseases;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ will make the front of their heads bald.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>At that time the Lord will remove their beautiful ankle jewelry, neck ornaments, crescent-shaped ornaments,
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>earrings, bracelets, veils,
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>headdresses, ankle ornaments, sashes, sachets, amulets,
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>rings, nose rings,
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>festive dresses, robes, shawls, purses,
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>garments, vests, head coverings, and gowns.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span>A putrid stench will replace the smell of spices,
>A rope will replace a belt,
>Baldness will replace braided locks of hair,
>A sackcloth garment will replace a fine robe,
>And a prisoner’s brand will replace beauty.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span>Your men will fall by the sword,
>Your strong men will die in battle.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span>Her gates will mourn and lament;
>Deprived of her people, she will sit on the ground.
