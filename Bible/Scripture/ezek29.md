## A Prophecy Against Egypt
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day of the month, the Lord’s message came to me:
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“Son of man, turn toward Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy against him and against all Egypt.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“Tell them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>‘Look, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The great monster lying in the midst of its waterways,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Who has said, “My Nile is my own, I made it for myself.”
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will put hooks in your jaws
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And stick the fish of your waterways to your scales.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will haul you up from the midst of your waterways,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And all the fish of your waterways will stick to your scales.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will leave you in the wilderness,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You and all the fish of your waterways;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You will fall in the open field and will not be gathered up or collected.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I have given you as food to the beasts of the earth and the birds of the skies.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Then all those living in Egypt will know that I am the Lᴏʀᴅ
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Because they were a reed staff for the house of Israel;
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>When they grasped you with their hand, you broke and tore their shoulders,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And when they leaned on you, you splintered and caused their legs to be unsteady.

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>“‘Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says: Look, I am about to bring a sword against you, and I will kill every person and every animal.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>‘The land of Egypt will become a desolate ruin. Then they will know that I am the Lᴏʀᴅ.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

“‘Because he said, “The Nile is mine and I made it,”
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>‘I am against you and your waterways. I will turn the land of Egypt into an utter desolate ruin from Migdol to Syene, as far as the border with Ethiopia.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>‘No human foot will pass through it, and no animal’s foot will pass through it; it will be uninhabited for forty years.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>‘I will turn the land of Egypt into a desolation in the midst of desolate lands; for forty years her cities will lie desolate in the midst of ruined cities. I will scatter Egypt among the nations and disperse them among foreign countries.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>“‘For this is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says: At the end of forty years I will gather Egypt from the peoples where they were scattered.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>‘I will restore the fortunes of Egypt and will bring them back to the land of Pathros, to the land of their origin; there they will be an insignificant kingdom.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>‘It will be the most insignificant of the kingdoms; it will never again exalt itself over the nations. I will make them so small that they will not rule over the nations.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>‘It will never again be Israel’s source of confidence, but a reminder of how they sinned by turning to Egypt for help. Then they will know that I am the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ.’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 17
<span class=verse-first>17</span>In the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the Lord’s message came to me:
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>“Son of man, King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon made his army labor hard against Tyre. Every head was rubbed bald and every shoulder rubbed bare; yet he and his army received no wages from Tyre for the work he carried out against it.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>“Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says: Look, I am about to give the land of Egypt to King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon. He will carry off her wealth, capture her loot, and seize her plunder; it will be his army’s wages.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>“I have given him the land of Egypt as his compensation for attacking Tyre, because they did it for me, declares the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 21
<span class=verse-first>21</span>“On that day I will make Israel powerful, and I will give you the right to be heard among them. Then they will know that I am the Lᴏʀᴅ.”
