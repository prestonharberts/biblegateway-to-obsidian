## Salutation
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 2
<span class=verse-first>2</span>to Timothy, my genuine child in the faith. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord!
## Timothy’s Task in Ephesus
###### 3
<span class=verse-first>3</span>As I urged you when I was leaving for Macedonia, stay on in Ephesus to instruct certain people not to spread false teachings,
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>nor to occupy themselves with myths and interminable genealogies. Such things promote useless speculations rather than God’s redemptive plan that operates by faith.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>But the aim of our instruction is love that comes from a pure heart, a good conscience, and a sincere faith.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>Some have strayed from these and turned away to empty discussion.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not understand what they are saying or the things they insist on so confidently.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>But we know that the law is good if someone uses it legitimately,
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>realizing that law is not intended for a righteous person, but for lawless and rebellious people, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers,
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>sexually immoral people, practicing homosexuals, kidnappers, liars, perjurers—in fact, for any who live contrary to sound teaching.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>This accords with the glorious gospel of the blessed God that was entrusted to me.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 12
<span class=verse-first>12</span>I am grateful to the one who has strengthened me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he considered me faithful in putting me into ministry,
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>even though I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor, and an arrogant man. But I was treated with mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief,
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>and our Lord’s grace was abundant, bringing faith and love in Christ Jesus.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>This saying is trustworthy and deserves full acceptance: “Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners”—and I am the worst of them!
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>But here is why I was treated with mercy: so that in me as the worst, Christ Jesus could demonstrate his utmost patience, as an example for those who are going to believe in him for eternal life.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>Now to the eternal king, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever! Amen.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span>I put this charge before you, Timothy my child, in keeping with the prophecies once spoken about you, in order that with such encouragement you may fight the good fight.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>To do this you must hold firmly to faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and so have suffered shipwreck in regard to the faith.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme.
