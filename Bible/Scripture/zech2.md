## Vision Three: The Surveyor
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span> I looked again, and there was a man with a measuring line in his hand.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>I asked, “Where are you going?” He replied, “To measure Jerusalem in order to determine its width and its length.”
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>At this point the angelic messenger who spoke to me went out, and another messenger came to meet him
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>and said to him, “Hurry, speak to this young man as follows: ‘Jerusalem will no longer be enclosed by walls because of the multitude of people and animals there.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>‘But I,’ the Lᴏʀᴅ says, ‘will be a wall of fire surrounding Jerusalem and the source of glory in her midst.’”

###### 6
<span class=verse-first>6</span>“You there! Flee from the northland!” says the Lᴏʀᴅ, “for like the four winds of heaven I have scattered you,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“Escape, Zion, you who live among the Babylonians!”
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies says: “For his own glory he has sent me to the nations that plundered you—for anyone who touches you touches the pupil of his eye.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>“Yes, look here, I am about to punish them so that they will be looted by their own slaves.” Then you will know that the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies has sent me.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“Sing out and be happy, Zion my daughter! For look, I have come; I will settle in your midst,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>“Many nations will join themselves to the Lᴏʀᴅ on the day of salvation, and they will also be my people. Indeed, I will settle in the midst of you all. Then you will know that the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies has sent me to you.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>“The Lᴏʀᴅ will take possession of Judah as his portion in the holy land and he will choose Jerusalem once again.

###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>“Be silent in the Lᴏʀᴅ’s presence, all people everywhere, for he is being moved to action in his holy dwelling place.”
