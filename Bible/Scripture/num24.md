## Balaam Prophesies Yet Again
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>When Balaam saw that it pleased the Lᴏʀᴅ to bless Israel, he did not go as at the other times to seek for omens, but he set his face toward the wilderness.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>When Balaam lifted up his eyes, he saw Israel camped tribe by tribe; and the Spirit of God came upon him.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>Then he uttered this oracle:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The oracle of Balaam son of Beor,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The oracle of the man whose eyes are open,
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The oracle of the one who hears the words of God,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who sees a vision from the Almighty,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Although falling flat on the ground with eyes open:
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>How beautiful are your tents, O Jacob,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And your dwelling places, O Israel!
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They are like valleys stretched forth,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Like gardens by the river’s side,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Like aloes that the Lᴏʀᴅ has planted,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And like cedar trees beside the waters.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He will pour the water out of his buckets,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And their descendants will be like abundant water;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Their king will be greater than Agag,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And their kingdom will be exalted.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>God brought them out of Egypt.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They have, as it were, the strength of a young bull;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They will devour hostile people,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And will break their bones,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And will pierce them through with arrows.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They crouch and lie down like a lion,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And as a lioness, who can stir him?
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Blessed is the one who blesses you,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And cursed is the one who curses you!’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>Then Balak became very angry at Balaam, and he struck his hands together. Balak said to Balaam, “I called you to curse my enemies, and look, you have done nothing but bless them these three times!
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>“So now, go back where you came from! I said that I would greatly honor you, but now the Lᴏʀᴅ has stood in the way of your honor.”
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>Balaam said to Balak, “Did I not also tell your messengers whom you sent to me,
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>‘If Balak would give me his palace full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the Lᴏʀᴅ to do either good or evil of my own will, but whatever the Lᴏʀᴅ tells me I must speak’?
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>“And now, I am about to go back to my own people. Come now, and I will advise you as to what this people will do to your people in future days.”
## Balaam Prophesies a Fourth Time
###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>Then he uttered this oracle:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The oracle of Balaam son of Beor,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The oracle of the man whose eyes are open,
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The oracle of the one who hears the words of God,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And who knows the knowledge of the Most High,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who sees a vision from the Almighty,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Although falling flat on the ground with eyes open:
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I see him, but not now;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I behold him, but not close at hand.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>A star will march forth out of Jacob,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And a scepter will rise out of Israel.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He will crush the skulls of Moab,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And the heads of all the sons of Sheth.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Edom will be a possession,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Seir, his enemy, will also be a possession;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>But Israel will act valiantly.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>A ruler will be established from Jacob;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>He will destroy the remains of the city.’”
## Balaam’s Final Prophecies
###### 20
<span class=verse-first>20</span>Then Balaam looked on Amalek and delivered this oracle:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Amalek was the first of the nations,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But his end will be that he will perish.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 21
<span class=verse-first>21</span>Then he looked on the Kenites and uttered this oracle:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your dwelling place seems strong,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And your nest is set on a rocky cliff.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Nevertheless the Kenite will be consumed.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How long will Asshur take you away captive?”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 23
<span class=verse-first>23</span>Then he uttered this oracle:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>O, who will survive when God does this!
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Ships will come from the coast of Kittim,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And will afflict Asshur, and will afflict Eber,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And he will also perish forever.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 25
