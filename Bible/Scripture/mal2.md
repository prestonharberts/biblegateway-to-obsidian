## The Sacrilege of the Priestly Message
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>“Now, you priests, this commandment is for you.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“If you do not listen and take seriously the need to honor my name,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies, “I will send judgment on you and turn your blessings into curses—indeed, I have already done so because you are not taking it to heart.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“I am about to discipline your children and will spread offal on your faces, the very offal produced at your festivals, and you will be carried away along with it.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>Then you will know that I sent this commandment to you so that my covenant may continue to be with Levi,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“My covenant with him was designed to bring life and peace. I gave its statutes to him to fill him with awe, and he indeed revered me and stood in awe before me.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>“He taught what was true; sinful words were not found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and integrity, and he turned many people away from sin.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“For the lips of a priest should preserve knowledge of sacred things, and people should seek instruction from him because he is the messenger of the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>“You, however, have turned from the way. You have caused many to violate the law; you have corrupted the covenant with Levi,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>“Therefore, I have caused you to be ignored and belittled before all people to the extent that you are not following after me and are showing partiality in your instruction.”
## The Rebellion of the People
###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>Do we not all have one father? Did not one God create us? Why do we betray one another, thus making light of the covenant of our ancestors?
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>Judah has become disloyal, and unspeakable sins have been committed in Israel and Jerusalem. For Judah has profaned the holy things that the Lᴏʀᴅ loves and has turned to a foreign god!
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>May the Lᴏʀᴅ cut off from the community of Jacob every last person who does this, as well as the person who presents improper offerings to the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>You also do this: You cover the altar of the Lᴏʀᴅ with tears as you weep and groan, because he no longer pays any attention to the offering nor accepts it favorably from you.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>Yet you ask, “Why?” The Lᴏʀᴅ is testifying against you on behalf of the wife you married when you were young, to whom you have become unfaithful even though she is your companion and wife by law.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>No one who has even a small portion of the Spirit in him does this. What did our ancestor do when seeking a child from God? Be attentive, then, to your own spirit, for one should not be disloyal to the wife he took in his youth.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>“I hate divorce,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ God of Israel, “and the one who is guilty of violence,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies. “Pay attention to your conscience, and do not be unfaithful.”
## Resistance to the Lord through Self-deceit
###### 17
<span class=verse-first>17</span>You have wearied the Lᴏʀᴅ with your words. But you say, “How have we wearied him?” Because you say, “Everyone who does evil is good in the Lᴏʀᴅ’s opinion, and he delights in them,” or, “Where is the God of justice?”
