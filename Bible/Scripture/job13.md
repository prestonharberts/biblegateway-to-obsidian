## Job Pleads His Cause to God
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, my eyes have seen all this,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My ears have heard and understood it.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>What you know, I know also;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I am not inferior to you!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 3
><span class=verse-first-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But I wish to speak to the Almighty,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I desire to argue my case with God.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But you, however, are inventors of lies;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All of you are worthless physicians!
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If only you would keep completely silent!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For you, that would be wisdom.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Listen now to my argument,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And be attentive to my lips’ contentions.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will you speak wickedly on God’s behalf?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will you speak deceitfully for him?
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will you show him partiality?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Will you argue the case for God?
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Would it turn out well if he would examine you?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or as one deceives a man would you deceive him?
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He would certainly rebuke you
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If you secretly showed partiality.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Would not his splendor terrify you
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the fear he inspires fall on you?
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your maxims are proverbs of ashes;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Your defenses are defenses of clay.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
><span class=verse-first-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Refrain from talking with me so that I may speak;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then let come to me what may.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why do I put myself in peril,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And take my life in my hands?
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Even if he slays me, I will hope in him;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will surely defend my ways to his face.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Moreover, this will become my deliverance,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For no godless person would come before him.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Listen carefully to my words;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let your ears be attentive to my explanation.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>See now, I have prepared my case;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I know that I am right.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who will contend with me?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If anyone can, I will be silent and die.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 20
><span class=verse-first-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Only in two things spare me, O God,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And then I will not hide from your face:
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Remove your hand far from me
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And stop making me afraid with your terror.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then call, and I will answer,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or I will speak, and you respond to me.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How many are my iniquities and sins?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Show me my transgression and my sin.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Why do you hide your face
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And regard me as your enemy?
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do you wish to torment a windblown leaf
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And chase after dry chaff?
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For you write down bitter things against me
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And cause me to inherit the sins of my youth.
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And you put my feet in the stocks
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And you watch all my movements;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You put marks on the soles of my feet.
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So I waste away like something rotten,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a garment eaten by moths.
