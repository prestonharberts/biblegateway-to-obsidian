## Land Robbers Will Lose Their Land
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Beware wicked schemers,
>Those who devise calamity as they lie in bed.
>As soon as morning dawns they carry out their plans,
>Because they have the power to do so.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>They confiscate the fields they desire
>And seize the houses they want.
>They defraud people of their homes
>And deprive people of the land they have inherited.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>Therefore the Lᴏʀᴅ says this:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look, I am devising disaster for this nation!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>It will be like a yoke from which you cannot free your neck.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will no longer walk proudly,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For it will be a time of catastrophe.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In that day people will sing this taunt song to you—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will mock you with this lament:
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>We are completely destroyed;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They sell off the property of my people.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>How they remove it from me!
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They assign our fields to the conqueror.’”
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Therefore no one will assign you land in the Lᴏʀᴅ’s community.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 6
><span class=verse-first-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Don’t preach with such impassioned rhetoric,” they say excitedly.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>These prophets should not preach of such things;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>We will not be overtaken by humiliation.”
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Does the family of Jacob say,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ’s patience can’t be exhausted—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He would never do such things”?
>To be sure, my commands bring a reward
>For those who obey them,
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>But you rise up as an enemy against my people.
>You steal a robe from a friend,
>From those who pass by peacefully as if returning from a war.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>You wrongly evict widows among my people from their cherished homes.
>You defraud their children of their prized inheritance.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>But you are the ones who will be forced to leave!
>For this land is not secure;
>Sin will thoroughly destroy it!
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>If a lying windbag should come and say,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I’ll promise you blessings of wine and beer,’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He would be just the right preacher for these people!”
## The Lord Will Restore His People
###### 12
><span class=verse-first-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will certainly gather all of you, O Jacob,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will certainly assemble those Israelites who remain.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will bring them together like sheep in a fold,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Like a flock in the middle of a pasture;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will be so numerous that they will make a lot of noise.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The one who can break through barriers will lead them out;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will break out, pass through the gate, and leave.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their king will advance before them;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ himself will lead them.”
