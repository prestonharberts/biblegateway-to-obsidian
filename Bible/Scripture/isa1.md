## Heading
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Here is the message about Judah and Jerusalem that was revealed to Isaiah son of Amoz during the time when Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah reigned over Judah.
## Obedience, not Sacrifice
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Listen, O heavens,
>Pay attention, O earth!
>For the Lᴏʀᴅ speaks:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I raised children, I brought them up,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But they have rebelled against me!
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>An ox recognizes its owner,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>A donkey recognizes where its owner puts its food;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But Israel does not recognize me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My people do not understand.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span>Beware sinful nation,
>The people weighed down by evil deeds.
>They are offspring who do wrong,
>Children who do wicked things.
>They have abandoned the Lᴏʀᴅ,
>And rejected the Holy One of Israel.
>They are alienated from him.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 5
><span class=verse-first-poetry>5</span>Why do you insist on being battered?
>Why do you continue to rebel?
>Your head has a massive wound,
>Your whole heart is sick.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>From the soles of your feet to your head,
>There is no spot that is unharmed.
>There are only bruises, cuts,
>And open wounds.
>They have not been cleansed or bandaged,
>Nor have they been treated with olive oil.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
><span class=verse-first-poetry>7</span>Your land is devastated,
>Your cities burned with fire.
>Right before your eyes your crops
>Are being destroyed by foreign invaders.
>They leave behind devastation and destruction.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Daughter Zion is left isolated,
>Like a hut in a vineyard,
>Or a shelter in a cucumber field;
>She is a besieged city.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>If the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies had not left us a few survivors,
>We would have quickly been like Sodom,
>We would have become like Gomorrah.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
><span class=verse-first-poetry>10</span>Listen to the Lᴏʀᴅ’s message,
>You leaders of Sodom!
>Pay attention to our God’s rebuke,
>People of Gomorrah!
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Of what importance to me are your many sacrifices?”
>Says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have had my fill of burnt sacrifices,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Of rams and the fat from steers.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The blood of bulls, lambs, and goats
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I do not want.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When you enter my presence,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do you actually think I want this—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Animals trampling on my courtyards?
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not bring any more meaningless offerings;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I consider your incense detestable!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You observe new moon festivals, Sabbaths, and convocations,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But I cannot tolerate sin-stained celebrations!
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I hate your new moon festivals and assemblies;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are a burden
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That I am tired of carrying.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When you spread out your hands in prayer,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I look the other way;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When you offer your many prayers,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I do not listen,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because your hands are covered with blood.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 16
><span class=verse-first-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Wash! Cleanse yourselves!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Remove your sinful deeds
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>From my sight.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Stop sinning.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Learn to do what is right.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Promote justice.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Give the oppressed reason to celebrate.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Take up the cause of the orphan.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Defend the rights of the widow.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
><span class=verse-first-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Come, let’s consider your options,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Though your sins have stained you like the color red,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You can become white like snow;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Though they are as easy to see as the color scarlet,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You can become white like wool.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>If you have a willing attitude and obey,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then you will again eat the good crops of the land.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But if you refuse and rebel,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will be devoured by the sword.”
>Know for certain that the Lᴏʀᴅ has spoken.
## Purifying Judgment
###### 21
><span class=verse-first-poetry>21</span>How tragic that the once-faithful city
>Has become a prostitute!
>She was once a center of justice;
>Fairness resided in her—
>But now only murderers!
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>Your silver has become scum,
>Your beer is diluted with water.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span>Your officials are rebels,
>They associate with thieves.
>All of them love bribery,
>And look for payoffs.
>They do not take up the cause of the orphan,
>Or defend the rights of the widow.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 24
><span class=verse-first-poetry>24</span>Therefore, the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies,
>The Powerful One of Israel, says this:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Ah, I will seek vengeance against my adversaries,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will take revenge against my enemies.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will attack you;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will purify your metal with flux.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will remove all your slag.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will reestablish honest judges as in former times,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Wise advisers as in earlier days.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then you will be called, ‘The Just City,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Faithful Town.’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 27
><span class=verse-first-poetry>27</span>Zion will be freed by justice,
>And her returnees by righteousness.
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span>All rebellious sinners will be shattered,
>Those who abandon the Lᴏʀᴅ will perish.
###### 29
><span class=verse-body-poetry>29</span>Indeed, they will be ashamed of the sacred trees
>You find so desirable;
>You will be embarrassed because of the sacred orchards
>Where you choose to worship.
###### 30
><span class=verse-body-poetry>30</span>For you will be like a tree whose leaves wither,
>Like an orchard that is unwatered.
###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span>The powerful will be like a thread of yarn,
>Their deeds like a spark;
>Both will burn together,
>And no one will put out the fire.
