###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Look! Enemies are gathering in the north like water rising in a river.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will be like an overflowing stream.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will overwhelm the whole country and everything in it like a flood.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will overwhelm the cities and their inhabitants.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>People will cry out in alarm.

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The clatter of their chariots and the rumbling of their wheels.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will not turn back to save their children
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because they will be paralyzed with fear.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For the time has come
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To destroy all the Philistines.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The time has come to destroy all the help
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That remains for Tyre and Sidon.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, will destroy the Philistines,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That remnant that came from the island of Crete.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The people of Gaza will shave their heads in mourning.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The people of Ashkelon will be struck dumb.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How long will you gash yourselves to show your sorrow,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You who remain of Philistia’s power?
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How long will you cry out, ‘Oh, sword of the Lᴏʀᴅ,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>How long will it be before you stop killing?

><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Stay there and rest!’
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But how can it rest
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, have given it orders?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have ordered it to attack
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The people of Ashkelon and the seacoast.”
