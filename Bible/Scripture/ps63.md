###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>O God, you are my God. I long for you.
>My soul thirsts for you,
>My flesh yearns for you,
>In a dry and parched land where there is no water.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Yes, in the sanctuary I have seen you,
>And witnessed your power and splendor.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Because experiencing your loyal love is better than life itself,
>My lips will praise you.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>For this reason I will praise you while I live;
>In your name I will lift up my hands.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>As with choice meat you satisfy my soul.
>My mouth joyfully praises you,

###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span>Enemies seek to destroy my life,
>But they will descend into the depths of the earth.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Each one will be handed over to the sword;
>Their corpses will be eaten by jackals.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>But the king will rejoice in God;
>Everyone who takes oaths in his name will boast,
>For the mouths of those who speak lies will be shut up.
