###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>O Shepherd of Israel, pay attention,
>You who lead Joseph like a flock of sheep.
>You who sit enthroned above the cherubim, reveal your splendor.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>In the sight of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh reveal your power.
>Come and deliver us.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>O God, restore us.
>Smile on us. Then we will be delivered.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 4
><span class=verse-first-poetry>4</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ God of Heaven’s Armies,
>How long will you remain angry at your people while they pray to you?
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>You have given them tears as food;
>You have made them drink tears by the measure.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>You have made our neighbors dislike us,
>And our enemies insult us.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>O God of Heaven’s Armies, restore us.
>Smile on us. Then we will be delivered.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span>You uprooted a vine from Egypt;
>You drove out nations and transplanted it.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>You cleared the ground for it;
>It took root,
>And filled the land.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>The mountains were covered by its shadow,
>The highest cedars by its branches.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Its branches reached the Mediterranean Sea,
>And its shoots the Euphrates River.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Why did you break down its walls,
>So that all who pass by pluck its fruit?
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>The wild boars of the forest ruin it;
>The insects of the field feed on it.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
><span class=verse-first-poetry>14</span>O God of Heaven’s Armies, come back.
>Look down from heaven and take notice.
>Take care of this vine,
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>The root your right hand planted,
>The shoot you made to grow.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>It is burned and cut down.
>May those who did this die because you are displeased with them.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>May you give support to the one you have chosen,
>To the one whom you raised up for yourself.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>Then we will not turn away from you.
>Revive us and we will pray to you.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ God of Heaven’s Armies, restore us.
>Smile on us. Then we will be delivered.
