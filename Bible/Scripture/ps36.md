###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>An evil man is rebellious to the core.
>He does not fear God,
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>For he is too proud
>To recognize and give up his sin.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>The words he speaks are sinful and deceitful;
>He does not care about doing what is wise and right.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>While he lies in bed he plans ways to sin.
>He is committed to a sinful lifestyle;
>He does not reject what is evil.

>In your light we see light.
