## The Dispersion of the Nations at Babel
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The whole earth had a common language and a common vocabulary.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>When the people moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>Then they said to one another, “Come, let’s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” (They had brick instead of stone and tar instead of mortar.)
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>Then they said, “Come, let’s build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens so that we may make a name for ourselves. Otherwise we will be scattered across the face of the entire earth.”
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>But the Lᴏʀᴅ came down to see the city and the tower that the people had started building.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>And the Lᴏʀᴅ said, “If as one people all sharing a common language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be beyond them.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“Come, let’s go down and confuse their language so they won’t be able to understand each other.”
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>So the Lᴏʀᴅ scattered them from there across the face of the entire earth, and they stopped building the city.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>That is why its name was called Babel—because there the Lᴏʀᴅ confused the language of the entire world, and from there the Lᴏʀᴅ scattered them across the face of the entire earth.
