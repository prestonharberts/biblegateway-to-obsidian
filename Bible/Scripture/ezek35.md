## Prophecy Against Mount Seir
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Lord’s message came to me:
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“Son of man, turn toward Mount Seir, and prophesy against it.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“Say to it, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>‘Look, I am against you, Mount Seir;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will stretch out my hand against you
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And turn you into a desolate ruin.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will lay waste your cities,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And you will become desolate.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Then you will know that I am the Lᴏʀᴅ!
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>“‘You have shown unrelenting hostility and poured the people of Israel onto the blades of a sword at the time of their calamity, at the time of their final punishment.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>‘Therefore, as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ, I will subject you to bloodshed, and bloodshed will pursue you. Since you did not hate bloodshed, bloodshed will pursue you.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>‘I will turn Mount Seir into a desolate ruin; I will cut off from it the one who passes through or returns.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>‘I will fill its mountains with its dead; on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines, those killed by the sword will fall.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>‘I will turn you into a perpetual desolation, and your cities will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the Lᴏʀᴅ.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>“‘You said, “These two nations, these two lands will be mine, and we will possess them,” (although the Lᴏʀᴅ was there);
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>‘therefore, as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ, I will deal with you according to your anger and your envy, by which you acted spitefully against them. I will reveal myself to them when I judge you.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>‘Then you will know that I, the Lᴏʀᴅ, have heard all the insults you spoke against the mountains of Israel, saying, “They are desolate; they have been given to us for food.”
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>‘You exalted yourselves against me with your speech and hurled many insults against me—I have heard them all!
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>‘This is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says: While the whole earth rejoices, I will turn you into a desolation.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>‘As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel because it was desolate, so will I deal with you—you will be desolate, Mount Seir, and all Edom—all of it! Then they will know that I am the Lᴏʀᴅ.’”
