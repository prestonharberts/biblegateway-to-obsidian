###### 37
<span class=verse-body>37</span>‘Now, if such a carcass falls on any sowing seed which is to be sown, it is clean,

<span class=verse-body>43</span>‘Do not make yourselves detestable by any of the swarming things. You must not defile yourselves by them and become unclean by them,
###### 44
<span class=verse-body>44</span>‘for I am the Lᴏʀᴅ your God and you are to sanctify yourselves and be holy because I am holy. You must not defile yourselves by any of the swarming things that creep on the ground,
###### 45
<span class=verse-body>45</span>‘for I am the Lᴏʀᴅ who brought you up from the land of Egypt to be your God, and you are to be holy because I am holy.
