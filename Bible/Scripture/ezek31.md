## A Cedar in Lebanon
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>In the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, the Lord’s message came to me:
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and his hordes:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>‘Who are you like in your greatness?
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Consider Assyria, a cedar in Lebanon,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>With beautiful branches, like a forest giving shade,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And extremely tall;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Its top reached into the clouds.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The water made it grow;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Underground springs made it grow tall.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Rivers flowed all around the place it was planted,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>While smaller channels watered all the trees of the field.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Therefore it grew taller than all the trees of the field;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Its boughs grew large and its branches grew long,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Because of the plentiful water in its shoots.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>All the birds of the sky nested in its boughs;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Under its branches all the beasts of the field gave birth;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>In its shade all the great nations lived.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>It was beautiful in its loftiness, in the length of its branches;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For its roots went down deep to plentiful waters.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The cedars in the garden of God could not eclipse it,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Nor could the fir trees match its boughs;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The plane trees were as nothing compared to its branches;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>No tree in the garden of God could rival its beauty.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I made it beautiful with its many branches;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>All the trees of Eden, in the garden of God, envied it.

###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>“‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says: Because it was tall in stature, and its top reached into the clouds, and it was proud of its height,
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>‘I gave it over to the leader of the nations. He has judged it thoroughly, as its sinfulness deserves. I have thrown it out.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>‘Foreigners from the most terrifying nations have cut it down and left it to lie there on the mountains. In all the valleys its branches have fallen, and its boughs lie broken in the ravines of the land. All the peoples of the land have departed from its shade and left it.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>‘On its ruins all the birds of the sky will live, and all the wild animals will walk on its branches.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>‘For this reason no watered trees will grow so tall; their tops will not reach into the clouds, nor will the well-watered ones grow that high. For all of them have been appointed to die in the lower parts of the earth; they will be among mere mortals, with those who descend to the Pit.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>“‘This is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says: On the day it went down to Sheol I caused observers to lament. I covered it with the deep and held back its rivers; its plentiful water was restrained. I clothed Lebanon in black for it, and all the trees of the field wilted because of it.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>‘I made the nations shake at the sound of its fall, when I threw it down to Sheol, along with those who descend to the Pit. Then all the trees of Eden, the choicest and the best of Lebanon, all that were well-watered, were comforted in the earth below.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>‘Those who lived in its shade, its allies among the nations, also went down with it to Sheol, to those killed by the sword.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span>‘Which of the trees of Eden was like you in majesty and loftiness? You will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the lower parts of the earth; you will lie among the uncircumcised, with those killed by the sword! This is what will happen to Pharaoh and all his hordes, declares the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ.’”
