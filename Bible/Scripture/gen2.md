###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The heavens and the earth were completed with everything that was in them.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>By the seventh day God finished the work that he had been doing, and he ceased on the seventh day all the work that he had been doing.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>God blessed the seventh day and made it holy because on it he ceased all the work that he had been doing in creation.
## The Creation of Man and Woman
###### 4
<span class=verse-first>4</span>This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created—when the Lᴏʀᴅ God made the earth and heavens.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>Now no shrub of the field had yet grown on the earth, and no plant of the field had yet sprouted, for the Lᴏʀᴅ God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was no man to cultivate the ground.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>Springs would well up from the earth and water the whole surface of the ground.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ God formed the man from the soil of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ God planted an orchard in the east, in Eden; and there he placed the man he had formed.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ God made all kinds of trees grow from the soil, every tree that was pleasing to look at and good for food. (Now the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil were in the middle of the orchard.)
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>Now a river flows from Eden to water the orchard, and from there it divides into four headstreams.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>The name of the first is Pishon; it runs through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>(The gold of that land is pure; pearls and lapis lazuli are also there).
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>The name of the second river is Gihon; it runs through the entire land of Cush.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>The name of the third river is Tigris; it runs along the east side of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ God took the man and placed him in the orchard in Eden to care for it and to maintain it.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>Then the Lᴏʀᴅ God commanded the man, “You may freely eat fruit from every tree of the orchard,
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>“but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will surely die.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a companion for him who corresponds to him.”
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ God formed out of the ground every living animal of the field and every bird of the air. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them, and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>So the man named all the animals, the birds of the air, and the living creatures of the field, but for Adam no companion who corresponded to him was found.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>So the Lᴏʀᴅ God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep, and while he was asleep, he took part of the man’s side and closed up the place with flesh.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>Then the Lᴏʀᴅ God made a woman from the part he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>Then the man said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>This one at last is bone of my bones
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And flesh of my flesh;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>This one will be called ‘woman,’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For she was taken out of man.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>That is why a man leaves his father and mother and unites with his wife, and they become one family.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>The man and his wife were both naked, but they were not ashamed.
