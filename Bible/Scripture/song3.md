## The Lost Lover is Found
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>All night long on my bed
>I longed for my lover.
>I longed for him but he never appeared.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will arise and look all around throughout the town,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And throughout the streets and squares;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will search for my beloved.”
>I searched for him but I did not find him.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>The night watchmen found me—the ones who guard the city walls.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Have you seen my beloved?”
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>Scarcely had I passed them by
>When I found my beloved!
>I held onto him tightly and would not let him go
>Until I brought him to my mother’s house,
>To the bedroom chamber of the one who conceived me.
## The Adjuration Refrain
###### 5
><span class=verse-first-poetry>5</span>I admonish you, O maidens of Jerusalem,
>By the gazelles and by the young does of the open fields:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not awaken or arouse love until it pleases!”
## The Royal Wedding Procession
###### 6
><span class=verse-first-poetry>6</span>Who is this coming up from the wilderness
>Like a column of smoke,
>Like a fragrant billow of myrrh and frankincense,
>Every kind of fragrant powder of the traveling merchants?
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Look! It is Solomon’s portable couch!
>It is surrounded by sixty warriors,
>Some of Israel’s mightiest warriors.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>All of them are skilled with a sword,
>Well trained in the art of warfare.
>Each has his sword at his side,
>To guard against the terrors of the night.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>King Solomon made a sedan chair for himself
>Of wood imported from Lebanon.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Its posts were made of silver;
>Its back was made of gold.
>Its seat was upholstered with purple wool;
>Its interior was inlaid with leather by the maidens of Jerusalem.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Come out, O maidens of Zion,
>And gaze upon King Solomon!
>He is wearing the crown with which his mother crowned him
>On his wedding day,
>On the most joyous day of his life!
