###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Do not boast about tomorrow;
>For you do not know what a day may bring forth.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Let another praise you, and not your own mouth;
>Someone else, and not your own lips.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>A stone is heavy and sand is weighty,
>But vexation by a fool is more burdensome than the two of them.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>Wrath is cruel and anger is overwhelming,
>But who can stand before jealousy?
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Better is open rebuke
>Than hidden love.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Faithful are the wounds of a friend,
>But the kisses of an enemy are excessive.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>The one whose appetite is satisfied loathes honey,
>But to the hungry mouth every bitter thing is sweet.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Like a bird that wanders from its nest,
>So is a person who wanders from his home.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>Ointment and incense make the heart rejoice,
>Likewise the sweetness of one’s friend from sincere counsel.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Do not forsake your friend and your father’s friend,
>And do not enter your brother’s house in the day of your disaster;
>A neighbor nearby is better than a brother far away.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad,
>So that I may answer anyone who taunts me.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>A shrewd person saw danger—he hid himself;
>The naive passed right on by—they had to pay for it.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>Take a man’s garment when he has given security for a stranger,
>And hold him in pledge on behalf of a stranger.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span>If someone blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning,
>It will be counted as a curse to him.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>A continual dripping on a rainy day—
>A contentious wife makes herself like that.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>Whoever contains her has contained the wind
>Or can grasp oil with his right hand.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>As iron sharpens iron,
>So a person sharpens his friend.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>The one who tends a fig tree will eat its fruit,
>And whoever takes care of his master will be honored.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>As in water the face is reflected as a face,
>So a person’s heart reflects the person.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>As Death and Destruction are never satisfied,
>So the eyes of a person are never satisfied.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span>As the crucible is for silver and the furnace is for gold,
>So a person must put his praise to the test.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>If you should pound the fool in the mortar
>Among the grain with the pestle,
>His foolishness would not depart from him.

###### 23
><span class=verse-first-poetry>23</span>Pay careful attention to the condition of your flocks,
>Set your mind on your herds,
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span>For riches do not last forever,
>Nor does a crown last from generation to generation.
###### 25
><span class=verse-body-poetry>25</span>When the hay is removed and new grass appears,
>And the grass from the hills is gathered in,
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span>The lambs will be for your clothing,
>And the goats will be for the price of a field.
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span>And there will be enough goat’s milk for your food,
>For the food of your household,
>And for the sustenance of your servant girls.
