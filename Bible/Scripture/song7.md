###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span> How beautiful are your sandaled feet,
>O nobleman’s daughter!
>The curves of your thighs are like jewels,
>The work of the hands of a master craftsman.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>Your navel is a round mixing bowl—
>May it never lack mixed wine!
>Your belly is a mound of wheat,
>Encircled by lilies.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Your two breasts are like two fawns,
>Twins of a gazelle.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>Your neck is like a tower made of ivory.
>Your eyes are the pools in Heshbon
>By the gate of Bath Rabbim.
>Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon
>Overlooking Damascus.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel.
>The locks of your hair are like royal tapestries—
>The king is held captive in its tresses!
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>How beautiful you are! How lovely,
>O love, with your delights!
## The Palm Tree and the Palm Tree Climber
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Your stature is like a palm tree,
>And your breasts are like clusters of grapes.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>I want to climb the palm tree,
>And take hold of its fruit stalks.
>May your breasts be like the clusters of grapes,
>And may the fragrance of your breath be like apples!
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>May your mouth be like the best wine,
>Flowing smoothly for my beloved,
>Gliding gently over our lips as we sleep together.
## Poetic Refrain: Mutual Possession
###### 10
><span class=verse-first-poetry>10</span>I am my beloved’s,
>And he desires me!
## The Journey to the Countryside
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>Come, my beloved, let us go to the countryside;
>Let us spend the night in the villages.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Let us rise early to go to the vineyards,
>To see if the vines have budded,
>To see if their blossoms have opened,
>If the pomegranates are in bloom—
>There I will give you my love.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>The mandrakes send out their fragrance;
>Over our door is every delicacy,
>Both new and old, which I have stored up for you, my lover.
