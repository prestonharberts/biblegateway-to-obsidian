## Book 3 (Psalms 73-89)
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Certainly God is good to Israel,
>And to those whose motives are pure.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>But as for me, my feet almost slipped;
>My feet almost slid out from under me.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>For I envied those who are proud,
>As I observed the prosperity of the wicked.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>For they suffer no pain;
>Their bodies are strong and well fed.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>They are immune to the trouble common to men;
>They do not suffer as other men do.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>Arrogance is their necklace,
>And violence covers them like clothing.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Their prosperity causes them to do wrong;
>Their thoughts are sinful.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>They mock and say evil things;
>They proudly threaten violence.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>They speak as if they rule in heaven,
>And lay claim to the earth.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
><span class=verse-first-poetry>10</span>Therefore they have more than enough food to eat,
>And even suck up the water of the sea.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>They say, “How does God know what we do?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Is the Most High aware of what goes on?”
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Take a good look. This is what the wicked are like,
>Those who always have it so easy and get richer and richer.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>I concluded, “Surely in vain I have kept my motives pure
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And maintained a pure lifestyle.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I suffer all day long,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And am punished every morning.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
><span class=verse-first-poetry>15</span>If I had publicized these thoughts,
>I would have betrayed your people.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span>When I tried to make sense of this,
>It was troubling to me.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>Then I entered the precincts of God’s temple,
>And understood the destiny of the wicked.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>Surely you put them in slippery places;
>You bring them down to ruin.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span>How desolate they become in a mere moment.
>Terrifying judgments make their demise complete.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span>They are like a dream after one wakes up.
>O Lord, when you awake you will despise them.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 21
><span class=verse-first-poetry>21</span>Yes, my spirit was bitter,
>And my insides felt sharp pain.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span>I was ignorant and lacked insight;
>I was as senseless as an animal before you.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span>But I am continually with you;
>You hold my right hand.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span>You guide me by your wise advice,
>And then you will lead me to a position of honor.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 25
><span class=verse-first-poetry>25</span>Whom do I have in heaven but you?
>On earth there is no one I desire but you.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span>My flesh and my heart may grow weak,
>But God always protects my heart and gives me stability.
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span>Yes, look! Those far from you die;
>You destroy everyone who is unfaithful to you.
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span>But as for me, God’s presence is all I need.
>I have made the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ my shelter,
>As I declare all the things you have done.
