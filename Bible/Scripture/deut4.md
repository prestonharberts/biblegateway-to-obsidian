##### <span class=arrow-left></span>[[deut3|Prev]]<span class=navigation-separator></span>[[deut4notes|Notes]]<span class=navigation-separator></span>[[deut5|Next]]<span class=arrow-right></span>
## The Privileges of the Covenant
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Now, Israel, pay attention to the statutes and ordinances I am about to teach you, so that you might live and go on to enter and take possession of the land that the Lᴏʀᴅ, the God of your ancestors, is giving you.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>Do not add a thing to what I command you nor subtract from it, so that you may keep the commandments of the Lᴏʀᴅ your God that I am delivering to you.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>You have witnessed what the Lᴏʀᴅ did at Baal Peor, how he eradicated from your midst everyone who followed Baal Peor.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>But you who remained faithful to the Lᴏʀᴅ your God are still alive to this very day, every one of you.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 5
<span class=verse-first>5</span>Look! I have taught you statutes and ordinances just as the Lᴏʀᴅ my God told me to do, so that you might carry them out in the land you are about to enter and possess.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>So be sure to do them, because this will testify of your wise understanding to the people who will learn of all these statutes and say, “Indeed, this great nation is a very wise people.”
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>In fact, what other great nation has a god so near to them like the Lᴏʀᴅ our God whenever we call on him?
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>And what other great nation has statutes and ordinances as just as this whole law that I am about to share with you today?
## Reminder of the Horeb Covenant
###### 9
<span class=verse-first>9</span>Again, however, pay very careful attention, lest you forget the things you have seen and disregard them for the rest of your life; instead teach them to your children and grandchildren.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>You stood before the Lᴏʀᴅ your God at Horeb and he said to me, “Assemble the people before me so that I can tell them my commands. Then they will learn to revere me all the days they live in the land, and they will instruct their children.”
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>You approached and stood at the foot of the mountain, a mountain ablaze to the sky above it and yet dark with a thick cloud.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>Then the Lᴏʀᴅ spoke to you from the middle of the fire; you heard speech but you could not see anything—only a voice was heard.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>And he revealed to you the covenant he has commanded you to keep, the Ten Commandments, writing them on two stone tablets.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>Moreover, at that same time the Lᴏʀᴅ commanded me to teach you statutes and ordinances for you to keep in the land that you are about to enter and possess.
## The Nature of Israel’s God
###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>Be very careful, then, because you saw no form at the time the Lᴏʀᴅ spoke to you at Horeb from the middle of the fire.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>I say this so you will not corrupt yourselves by making an image in the form of any kind of figure. This includes the likeness of a human male or female,
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>any kind of land animal, any bird that flies in the sky,
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>anything that crawls on the ground, or any fish in the deep waters under the earth.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>When you look up to the sky and see the sun, moon, and stars—the whole heavenly creation—you must not be seduced to worship and serve them, for the Lᴏʀᴅ your God has assigned them to all the people of the world.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>You, however, the Lᴏʀᴅ has selected and brought from Egypt, that iron-smelting furnace, to be his special people as you are today.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 21
<span class=verse-first>21</span>But the Lᴏʀᴅ became angry with me because of you and vowed that I would never cross the Jordan nor enter the good land that he is about to give you.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>So I must die here in this land; I will not cross the Jordan. But you are going over and will possess that good land.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>Be on guard so that you do not forget the covenant of the Lᴏʀᴅ your God that he has made with you, and that you do not make an image of any kind, just as he has forbidden you.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ your God is a consuming fire; he is a jealous God.
## Threat and Blessing following Covenant Disobedience
###### 25
<span class=verse-first>25</span>After you have produced children and grandchildren and have been in the land a long time, if you become corrupt and make an image of any kind and do other evil things before the Lᴏʀᴅ your God that enrage him,
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>I invoke heaven and earth as witnesses against you today that you will surely and swiftly be removed from the very land you are about to cross the Jordan to possess. You will not last long there because you will surely be annihilated.
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>Then the Lᴏʀᴅ will scatter you among the peoples and there will be very few of you among the nations where the Lᴏʀᴅ will drive you.
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>There you will worship gods made by human hands—wood and stone that can neither see, hear, eat, nor smell.
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>But if you seek the Lᴏʀᴅ your God from there, you will find him, if, indeed, you seek him with all your heart and soul.
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>In your distress when all these things happen to you in future days, if you return to the Lᴏʀᴅ your God and obey him
###### 31
<span class=verse-body>31</span>(for he is a merciful God), he will not let you down or destroy you, for he cannot forget the covenant with your ancestors that he confirmed by oath to them.
## The Uniqueness of Israel’s God
###### 32
<span class=verse-first>32</span>Indeed, ask about the distant past, starting from the day God created humankind on the earth, and ask from one end of heaven to the other, whether there has ever been such a great thing as this, or even a rumor of it.
###### 33
<span class=verse-body>33</span>Have a people ever heard the voice of God speaking from the middle of fire, as you yourselves have, and lived to tell about it?
###### 34
<span class=verse-body>34</span>Or has God ever before tried to deliver a nation from the middle of another nation, accompanied by judgments, signs, wonders, war, strength, power, and other very terrifying things like the Lᴏʀᴅ your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes?
###### 35
<span class=verse-body>35</span>You have been taught that the Lᴏʀᴅ alone is God—there is no other besides him.
###### 36
<span class=verse-body>36</span>From heaven he spoke to you in order to teach you, and on earth he showed you his great fire from which you also heard his words.
###### 37
<span class=verse-body>37</span>Moreover, because he loved your ancestors, he chose their descendants who followed them and personally brought you out of Egypt with his great power
###### 38
<span class=verse-body>38</span>to dispossess nations greater and stronger than you and brought you here this day to give you their land as your property.
###### 39
<span class=verse-body>39</span>Today realize and carefully consider that the Lᴏʀᴅ is God in heaven above and on earth below—there is no other!
###### 40
<span class=verse-body>40</span>Keep his statutes and commandments that I am setting forth today so that it may go well with you and your descendants and that you may enjoy longevity in the land that the Lᴏʀᴅ your God is about to give you as a permanent possession.”
## The Narrative Concerning Cities of Refuge
###### 41
<span class=verse-first>41</span>Then Moses selected three cities in the Transjordan, toward the east.
###### 42
<span class=verse-body>42</span>Anyone who accidentally killed someone without hating him at the time of the accident could flee to one of those cities and be safe.
###### 43
<span class=verse-body>43</span>These cities are Bezer, in the wilderness plateau, for the Reubenites; Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan for the Manassehites.
## The Setting and Introduction of the Covenant
###### 44
<span class=verse-first>44</span>This is the law that Moses set before the Israelites.
###### 45
<span class=verse-body>45</span>These are the stipulations, statutes, and ordinances that Moses spoke to the Israelites after he had brought them out of Egypt,
###### 46
<span class=verse-body>46</span>in the Transjordan, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, in the land of King Sihon of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon. It is he whom Moses and the Israelites attacked after they came out of Egypt.
###### 47
<span class=verse-body>47</span>They possessed his land and that of King Og of Bashan—both of whom were Amorite kings in the Transjordan, to the east.
###### 48
<span class=verse-body>48</span>Their territory extended from Aroer at the edge of the Arnon valley as far as Mount Siyon—that is, Hermon—
###### 49
<span class=verse-body>49</span>including all the rift valley of the Transjordan in the east to the sea of the rift valley, beneath the slopes of Pisgah.
