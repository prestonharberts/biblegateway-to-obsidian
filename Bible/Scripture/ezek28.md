## A Prophecy Against the King of Tyre
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Lord’s message came to me:
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>‘Your heart is proud and you said, “I am a god;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I sit in the seat of gods, in the heart of the seas”—
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Yet you are a man and not a god,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Though you think you are godlike.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Look, you are wiser than Daniel;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>No secret is hidden from you.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>By your wisdom and understanding you have gained wealth for yourself;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You have amassed gold and silver in your treasuries.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>By your great skill in trade you have increased your wealth,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And your heart is proud because of your wealth.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says:
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Because you think you are godlike,
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I am about to bring foreigners against you, the most terrifying of nations.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They will draw their swords against the grandeur made by your wisdom,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And they will defile your splendor.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>They will bring you down to the Pit, and you will die violently in the heart of the seas.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Will you still say, “I am a god,” before the one who kills you—
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Though you are a man and not a god—
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>When you are in the power of those who wound you?
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You will die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of foreigners;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For I have spoken, declares the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ.’”

###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>The Lord’s message came to me:
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>“Son of man, sing a lament for the king of Tyre, and say to him, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>‘You were the sealer of perfection,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You were in Eden, the garden of God.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Every precious stone was your covering,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The ruby, topaz, and emerald,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The chrysolite, onyx, and jasper,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The sapphire, turquoise, and beryl;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Your settings and mounts were made of gold.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>On the day you were created they were prepared.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I placed you there with an anointed guardian cherub;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You were on the holy mountain of God;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You walked about amidst fiery stones.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You were blameless in your behavior from the day you were created,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Until sin was discovered in you.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>In the abundance of your trade you were filled with violence, and you sinned;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>So I defiled you and banished you from the mountain of God—
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The guardian cherub expelled you from the midst of the stones of fire.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Your heart was proud because of your beauty;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You corrupted your wisdom on account of your splendor.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I threw you down to the ground;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I placed you before kings, that they might see you.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>By the multitude of your iniquities, through the sinfulness of your trade,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You desecrated your sanctuaries.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>So I drew fire out from within you;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>It consumed you,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And I turned you to ashes on the earth
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Before the eyes of all who saw you.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>All who know you among the peoples are shocked at you;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>You have become terrified and will be no more.’”

<span class=verse-first>25</span>“‘This is what the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ says: When I regather the house of Israel from the peoples where they are dispersed, I will reveal my sovereign power over them in the sight of the nations, and they will live in their land that I gave to my servant Jacob.
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>‘They will live securely in it; they will build houses and plant vineyards. They will live securely when I execute my judgments on all those who scorn them and surround them. Then they will know that I am the Lᴏʀᴅ their God.’”
