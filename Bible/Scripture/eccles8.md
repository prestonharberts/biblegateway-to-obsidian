## Human Government Demonstrates Limitations of Wisdom
###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Who is a wise person? Who knows the solution to a problem?
>A person’s wisdom brightens his appearance, and softens his harsh countenance.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 2
><span class=verse-first-poetry>2</span>Obey the king’s command,
>Because you took an oath before God to be loyal to him.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Do not rush out of the king’s presence in haste—do not delay when the matter is unpleasant,
>For he can do whatever he pleases.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>Surely the king’s authority is absolute;
>No one can say to him, “What are you doing?”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 5
><span class=verse-first-poetry>5</span>Whoever obeys his command will not experience harm,
>And a wise person knows the proper time and procedure.
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter,
>For the oppression of the king is severe upon his victim.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Surely no one knows the future,
>And no one can tell another person what will happen.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>Just as no one has power over the wind to restrain it,
>So no one has power over the day of his death.
>Just as no one can be discharged during the battle,
>So wickedness cannot rescue the wicked.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>While applying my mind to everything that happens in this world, I have seen all this:
>Sometimes one person dominates other people to their harm.
## Contradictions to the Law of Retribution
###### 10
><span class=verse-first-poetry>10</span>Not only that, but I have seen the wicked approaching and entering the temple,
>And as they left the holy temple, they
>Boasted in the city that they had done so.
>This also is an enigma.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>When a sentence is not executed at once against a crime,
>The human heart is encouraged to do evil.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>Even though a sinner might commit a hundred crimes and still live a long time,
>Yet I know that it will go well with God-fearing people—for they stand in fear before him.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span>But it will not go well with the wicked,
>Nor will they prolong their days like a shadow,
>Because they do not stand in fear before God.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
><span class=verse-first-poetry>14</span>Here is another enigma that occurs on earth:
>Sometimes there are righteous people who get what the wicked deserve,
>And sometimes there are wicked people who get what the righteous deserve.
>I said, “This also is an enigma.”
## Enjoy Life In Spite of Its Injustices
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span>So I recommend the enjoyment of life,
>For there is nothing better on earth for a person to do except to eat, drink, and enjoy life.
>So joy will accompany him in his toil
>During the days of his life that God gives him on earth.
## Limitations of Human Wisdom
###### 16
><span class=verse-first-poetry>16</span>When I tried to gain wisdom
>And to observe the activity on earth—
>Even though it prevents anyone from sleeping day or night—
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>Then I discerned all that God has done:
>No one really comprehends what happens on earth.
>Despite all human efforts to discover it, no one can ever grasp it.
>Even if a wise person claimed that he understood,
>He would not really comprehend it.
