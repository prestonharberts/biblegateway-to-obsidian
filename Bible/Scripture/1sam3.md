## The Call of Samuel
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Now the boy Samuel continued serving the Lᴏʀᴅ under Eli’s supervision. Receiving a message from the Lᴏʀᴅ was rare in those days; revelatory visions were infrequent.

###### 2
<span class=verse-first>2</span>Eli’s eyes had begun to fail, so that he was unable to see well. At that time he was lying down in his place,
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>and the lamp of God had not yet been extinguished. Samuel was lying down in the temple of the Lᴏʀᴅ as well; the ark of God was also there.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ called to Samuel, and he replied, “Here I am!”
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>Then he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But Eli said, “I didn’t call you. Go back and lie down.” So he went back and lay down.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ again called, “Samuel!” So Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But Eli said, “I didn’t call you, my son. Go back and lie down.”
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>Now Samuel did not yet know the Lᴏʀᴅ; the Lᴏʀᴅ’s messages had not yet been revealed to him.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>Then the Lᴏʀᴅ called Samuel a third time. So he got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me!” Eli then realized that it was the Lᴏʀᴅ who was calling the boy.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>So Eli said to Samuel, “Go back and lie down. When he calls you, say, ‘Speak, Lᴏʀᴅ, for your servant is listening.’ So Samuel went back and lay down in his place.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>“Then the Lᴏʀᴅ came and stood nearby, calling as he had previously done, “Samuel! Samuel!” Samuel replied, “Speak, for your servant is listening!”
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said to Samuel, “Look! I am about to do something in Israel; when anyone hears about it, both of his ears will tingle.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>“On that day I will carry out against Eli everything that I spoke about his house—from start to finish!
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>“You should tell him that I am about to judge his house forever because of the sin that he knew about. For his sons were cursing God, and he did not rebuke them.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>“Therefore I swore an oath to the house of Eli, ‘The sin of the house of Eli can never be forgiven by sacrifice or by grain offering.’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 15
<span class=verse-first>15</span>So Samuel lay down until morning. Then he opened the doors of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s house. But Samuel was afraid to tell Eli about the vision.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>However, Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son!” He replied, “Here I am.”
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>Eli said, “What message did he speak to you? Don’t conceal it from me. God will judge you severely if you conceal from me anything that he said to you!”
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>So Samuel told him everything. He did not hold back anything from him. Eli said, “The Lᴏʀᴅ will do what he pleases.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 19
<span class=verse-first>19</span>Samuel continued to grow, and the Lᴏʀᴅ was with him. None of his prophecies fell to the ground unfulfilled.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>All Israel from Dan to Beer Sheba realized that Samuel was confirmed as a prophet of the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>Then the Lᴏʀᴅ again appeared in Shiloh, for it was in Shiloh that the Lᴏʀᴅ had revealed himself to Samuel through a message from the Lᴏʀᴅ.
