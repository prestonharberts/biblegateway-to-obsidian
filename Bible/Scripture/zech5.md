## Vision Six: The Flying Scroll
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Then I turned to look, and there was a flying scroll!
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>Someone asked me, “What do you see?” I replied, “I see a flying scroll 30 feet long and 15 feet wide.”
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>The speaker went on to say, “This is a curse traveling across the whole earth. For example, according to the curse whoever steals will be removed from the community; or on the other hand (according to the curse) whoever swears falsely will suffer the same fate.”
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“I will send it out,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies, “and it will enter the house of the thief and of the person who swears falsely in my name. It will land in the middle of his house and destroy both timber and stones.”
## Vision Seven: The Ephah
###### 5
<span class=verse-first>5</span>After this the angelic messenger who had been speaking to me went out and said, “Look, see what is leaving.”
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>I asked, “What is it?” And he replied, “It is a basket for measuring grain that is moving away from here.” Moreover, he said, “This is their ‘eye’ throughout all the earth.”
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>Then a round lead cover was raised up, revealing a woman sitting inside the basket.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>He then said, “This woman represents wickedness,” and he pushed her down into the basket and placed the lead cover on top.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>Then I looked again and saw two women going forth with the wind in their wings (they had wings like those of a stork), and they lifted up the basket between the earth and the sky.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>I asked the messenger who was speaking to me, “Where are they taking the basket?”
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>He replied, “To build a temple for her in the land of Babylonia. When it is finished, she will be placed there in her own residence.”
