## A Child is Born for a Sign
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ told me, “Take a large tablet and inscribe these words on it with an ordinary stylus: ‘Maher Shalal Hash Baz.’
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>“Then I will summon as my reliable witnesses Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah.”
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>I then approached the prophetess for marital relations; she conceived and gave birth to a son. The Lᴏʀᴅ told me, “Name him Maher Shalal Hash Baz,
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>“for before the child knows how to cry out ‘My father’ or ‘My mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 5
<span class=verse-first>5</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ spoke to me again:
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>“These people have rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah and melt in fear over Rezin and the son of Remaliah.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“So look, the Lord is bringing up against them the turbulent and mighty waters of the Euphrates River—the king of Assyria and all his majestic power. It will reach flood stage and overflow its banks.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>“It will spill into Judah, flooding and engulfing, as it reaches to the necks of its victims. He will spread his wings out over your entire land, O Immanuel.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span>You will be broken, O nations;
>You will be shattered!
>Pay attention, all you distant lands of the earth.
>Get ready for battle, and you will be shattered!
>Get ready for battle, and you will be shattered!
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Devise your strategy, but it will be thwarted.
>Issue your orders, but they will not be executed!
>For God is with us!
## The Lord Encourages Isaiah
###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>Indeed this is what the Lᴏʀᴅ told me quite forcefully. He warned me not to act like these people:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Do not say, ‘Conspiracy,’ every time these people say the word.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Don’t be afraid of what scares them; don’t be terrified.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You must recognize the authority of the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He is the one you must respect;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He is the one you must fear.
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will become a sanctuary,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But a stone that makes a person trip,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And a rock that makes one stumble—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To the two houses of Israel.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will become a trap and a snare
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To the residents of Jerusalem.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Many will stumble over the stone and the rock,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And will fall and be seriously injured,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And will be ensnared and captured.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 16
><span class=verse-first-poetry>16</span>Tie up the scroll as legal evidence,
>Seal the official record of God’s instructions and give it to my followers.
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span>I will wait patiently for the Lᴏʀᴅ,
>Who has rejected the family of Jacob;
>I will wait for him.
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span>Look, I and the sons whom the Lᴏʀᴅ has given me are reminders and object lessons in Israel, sent from the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies, who lives on Mount Zion.
## Darkness Turns to Light as an Ideal King Arrives
###### 19
<span class=verse-first>19</span>They will say to you, “Seek oracles at the pits used to conjure up underworld spirits, from the magicians who chirp and mutter incantations. Should people not seek oracles from their gods, by asking the dead about the destiny of the living?”
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>Then you must recall the Lᴏʀᴅ’s instructions and the prophetic testimony of what would happen. Certainly they say such things because their minds are spiritually darkened.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>They will pass through the land destitute and starving. Their hunger will make them angry, and they will curse their king and their God as they look upward.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>When one looks out over the land, he sees distress and darkness, gloom and anxiety, darkness and people forced from the land.
