## Balaam Blesses Israel
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Balaam said to Balak, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.”
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>So Balak did just as Balaam had said. Balak and Balaam then offered on each altar a bull and a ram.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>Balaam said to Balak, “Station yourself by your burnt offering, and I will go off; perhaps the Lᴏʀᴅ will come to meet me, and whatever he reveals to me I will tell you.” Then he went to a deserted height.

###### 4
<span class=verse-first>4</span>Then God met Balaam, who said to him, “I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered on each altar a bull and a ram.”
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>Then the Lᴏʀᴅ put a message in Balaam’s mouth and said, “Return to Balak, and speak what I tell you.”
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>So he returned to him, and he was still standing by his burnt offering, he and all the princes of Moab.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>Then Balaam uttered his oracle, saying,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Balak, the king of Moab, brought me from Aram,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Out of the mountains of the east, saying,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Come, pronounce a curse on Jacob for me;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Come, denounce Israel.’
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>How can I curse one whom God has not cursed,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or how can I denounce one whom the Lᴏʀᴅ has not denounced?
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For from the top of the rocks I see them;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>From the hills I watch them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, a nation that lives alone,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And it will not be reckoned among the nations.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who can count the dust of Jacob,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or number the fourth part of Israel?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Let me die the death of the upright,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And let the end of my life be like theirs.”
## Balaam Relocates
###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>Then Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but on the contrary you have only blessed them!”
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>Balaam replied, “Must I not be careful to speak what the Lᴏʀᴅ has put in my mouth?”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place from which you can observe them. You will see only a part of them, but you will not see all of them. Curse them for me from there.”
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>So Balak brought Balaam to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, where he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>And Balaam said to Balak, “Station yourself here by your burnt offering, while I meet the Lᴏʀᴅ there.”
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>Then the Lᴏʀᴅ met Balaam and put a message in his mouth and said, “Return to Balak, and speak what I tell you.”
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>When Balaam came to him, he was still standing by his burnt offering, along with the princes of Moab. And Balak said to him, “What has the Lᴏʀᴅ spoken?”
## Balaam Prophesies Again
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>Balaam uttered his oracle, and said,
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Rise up, Balak, and hear;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Listen to me, son of Zippor:
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>God is not a man, that he should lie,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Nor a human being, that he should change his mind.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Has he said, and will he not do it?
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or has he spoken, and will he not make it happen?
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, I have received a command to bless;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He has blessed, and I cannot reverse it.
###### 21
><span class=verse-body-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He has not looked on iniquity in Jacob,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Nor has he seen trouble in Israel.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ their God is with them;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>His acclamation as king is among them.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>God brought them out of Egypt.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They have, as it were, the strength of a wild bull.
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For there is no spell against Jacob,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Nor is there any divination against Israel.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>At this time it must be said of Jacob
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And of Israel, ‘Look at what God has done!’
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Indeed, the people will rise up like a lioness,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And like a lion raises himself up;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will not lie down until they eat their prey,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And drink the blood of the slain.”
## Balaam Relocates Yet Again
###### 25
<span class=verse-first>25</span>Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all nor bless them at all!”
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>But Balaam replied to Balak, “Did I not tell you, ‘All that the Lᴏʀᴅ speaks, I must do’?”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 27
<span class=verse-first>27</span>Balak said to Balaam, “Come, please; I will take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them for me from there.”
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks toward the wastelands.
###### 29
<span class=verse-body>29</span>Then Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars here for me, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams.”
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>So Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
