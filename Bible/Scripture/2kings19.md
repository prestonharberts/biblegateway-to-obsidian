###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and went to the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>He sent Eliakim the palace supervisor, Shebna the scribe, and the leading priests, clothed in sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>They told him, “This is what Hezekiah says: ‘This is a day of distress, insults, and humiliation, as when a baby is ready to leave the birth canal, but the mother lacks the strength to push it through.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>‘Perhaps the Lᴏʀᴅ your God will hear all these things the chief adviser has spoken on behalf of his master, the king of Assyria, who sent him to taunt the living God. When the Lᴏʀᴅ your God hears, perhaps he will punish him for the things he has said. So pray for this remnant that remains.’”
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>When King Hezekiah’s servants came to Isaiah,
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>Isaiah said to them, “Tell your master this: ‘This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ has said: “Don’t be afraid because of the things you have heard, because the Assyrian king’s officers have insulted me.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>“Look, I will take control of his mind; he will receive a report and return to his own land. I will cut him down with a sword in his own land.”’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>When the chief adviser heard the king of Assyria had departed from Lachish, he left and went to Libnah, where the king was campaigning.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>The king heard that King Tirhakah of Ethiopia was marching out to fight him. He again sent messengers to Hezekiah, ordering them:
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“Tell King Hezekiah of Judah this: ‘Don’t let your God in whom you trust mislead you when he says, “Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.”
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>Certainly you have heard how the kings of Assyria have annihilated all lands. Do you really think you will be rescued?
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>Were the nations whom my ancestors destroyed—the nations of Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden in Telassar—rescued by their gods?
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>Where are the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, and the kings of Lair, Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
<span class=verse-first>14</span>Hezekiah took the letter from the messengers and read it. Then Hezekiah went up to the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple and spread it out before the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>Hezekiah prayed before the Lᴏʀᴅ: “Lᴏʀᴅ God of Israel, who is enthroned above the cherubim! You alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You made the sky and the earth.
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>“Pay attention, Lᴏʀᴅ, and hear! Open your eyes, Lᴏʀᴅ, and observe! Listen to the message Sennacherib sent and how he taunts the living God!
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>“It is true, Lᴏʀᴅ, that the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>“They have burned the gods of the nations, for they are not really gods, but only the product of human hands manufactured from wood and stone. That is why the Assyrians could destroy them.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>“Now, O Lᴏʀᴅ our God, rescue us from his power, so that all the kingdoms of the earth will know that you, Lᴏʀᴅ, are the only God.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 20
<span class=verse-first>20</span>Isaiah son of Amoz sent this message to Hezekiah: “This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ God of Israel has said: ‘I have heard your prayer concerning King Sennacherib of Assyria.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>‘This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ says about him:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>‘“The virgin daughter Zion
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Despises you, she makes fun of you;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Daughter Jerusalem
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Shakes her head after you.
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Whom have you taunted and hurled insults at?
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>At whom have you shouted,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And looked so arrogantly?
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>At the Holy One of Israel!
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Through your messengers you taunted the Sovereign Master,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>With my many chariots
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I climbed up the high mountains,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The slopes of Lebanon.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I cut down its tall cedars
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>And its best evergreens.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I invaded its most remote regions,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Its thickest woods.
###### 24
><span class=verse-body-poetry>24</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I dug wells and drank
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Water in foreign lands.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>With the soles of my feet I dried up
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>All the rivers of Egypt.’
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 25
><span class=verse-first-poetry>25</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Certainly you must have heard!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Long ago I worked it out.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In ancient times I planned it;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And now I am bringing it to pass.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The plan is this:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Fortified cities will crash
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Into heaps of ruins.
###### 26
><span class=verse-body-poetry>26</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Their residents are powerless,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are terrified and ashamed.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are as short-lived as plants in the field,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Or green vegetation.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are as short-lived as grass on the rooftops
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When it is scorched by the east wind.
###### 27
><span class=verse-body-poetry>27</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I know where you live
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And everything you do.
###### 28
><span class=verse-body-poetry>28</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because you rage against me,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the uproar you create has reached my ears,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will put my hook in your nose,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And my bridle between your lips,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I will lead you back the way
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You came.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 29
<span class=verse-first>29</span>“‘This will be your confirmation that I have spoken the truth: This year you will eat what grows wild, and next year what grows on its own from that. But in the third year you will plant seed and harvest crops; you will plant vines and consume their produce.
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>‘Those who remain in Judah will take root in the ground and bear fruit.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 31
><span class=verse-body-poetry>31</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>For a remnant will leave Jerusalem;
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Survivors will come out of Mount Zion.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>The zeal of the Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies will accomplish this.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 32
><span class=verse-first-poetry>32</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>So this is what the Lᴏʀᴅ has said about the king of Assyria:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will not enter this city,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Nor will he shoot an arrow here.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will not attack it with his shield-carrying warriors,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Nor will he build siege works against it.
###### 33
><span class=verse-body-poetry>33</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will go back the way he came.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will not enter this city,” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 34
<span class=verse-body>34</span>“‘I will shield this city and rescue it for the sake of my reputation and because of my promise to David my servant.’”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 35
<span class=verse-first>35</span>That very night the angel of the Lᴏʀᴅ went out and killed 185,000 in the Assyrian camp. When they got up early the next morning, there were all the corpses.
###### 36
<span class=verse-body>36</span>So King Sennacherib of Assyria broke camp and went on his way. He went home and stayed in Nineveh.
###### 37
<span class=verse-body>37</span>One day, as he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword. They escaped to the land of Ararat; his son Esarhaddon replaced him as king.
