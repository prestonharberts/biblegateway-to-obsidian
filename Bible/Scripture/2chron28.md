## Ahaz’s Reign
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do what pleased the Lᴏʀᴅ, in contrast to his ancestor David.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>He followed in the footsteps of the kings of Israel; he also made images of the Baals.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>He offered sacrifices in the Valley of Ben Hinnom and passed his sons through the fire, a horrible sin practiced by the nations whom the Lᴏʀᴅ drove out before the Israelites.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>He offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 5
<span class=verse-first>5</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ his God handed him over to the king of Syria. The Syrians defeated him and deported many captives to Damascus. He was also handed over to the king of Israel, who thoroughly defeated him.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>In one day Pekah son of Remaliah killed 120,000 warriors in Judah, because they had abandoned the Lᴏʀᴅ God of their ancestors.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>Zikri, an Ephraimite warrior, killed the king’s son Maaseiah, Azrikam, the supervisor of the palace, and Elkanah, the king’s second-in-command.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>The Israelites seized from their brothers 200,000 wives, sons, and daughters. They also carried off a huge amount of plunder and took it back to Samaria.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>Oded, a prophet of the Lᴏʀᴅ, was there. He went to meet the army as they arrived in Samaria and said to them: “Look, because the Lᴏʀᴅ God of your ancestors was angry with Judah he handed them over to you. You have killed them so mercilessly that God has taken notice.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“And now you are planning to enslave the people of Judah and Jerusalem. Yet are you not also guilty before the Lᴏʀᴅ your God?
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>“Now listen to me! Send back those you have seized from your brothers, for the Lᴏʀᴅ is very angry at you!”
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>So some of the Ephraimite family leaders, Azariah son of Jehochanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, Jechizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai confronted those returning from the battle.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>They said to them, “Don’t bring those captives here! Are you planning on making us even more sinful and guilty before the Lᴏʀᴅ? Our guilt is already great, and the Lᴏʀᴅ is very angry at Israel.”
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>So the soldiers released the captives and the plunder before the officials and the entire assembly.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>Men were assigned to take the prisoners and find clothes among the plunder for those who were naked. So they clothed them, supplied them with sandals, gave them food and drink, and provided them with oil to rub on their skin. They put the ones who couldn’t walk on donkeys. They brought them back to their brothers at Jericho, the city of date palm trees, and then returned to Samaria.

###### 16
<span class=verse-first>16</span>“At that time King Ahaz asked the king of Assyria for help.
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>“The Edomites had again invaded and defeated Judah and carried off captives.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>“The Philistines had raided the cities of Judah in the foothills and the Negev. They captured and settled in Beth Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco and its surrounding villages, Timnah and its surrounding villages, and Gimzo and its surrounding villages.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>“The Lᴏʀᴅ humiliated Judah because of King Ahaz of Israel, for he encouraged Judah to sin and was very unfaithful to the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>“King Tiglath-Pileser of Assyria came, but he gave him more trouble than support.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>“Ahaz gathered riches from the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple, the royal palace, and the officials and gave them to the king of Assyria, but that did not help.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 22
<span class=verse-first>22</span>“During his time of trouble King Ahaz was even more unfaithful to the Lᴏʀᴅ.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>“He offered sacrifices to the gods of Damascus whom he thought had defeated him. He reasoned, “Since the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, I will sacrifice to them so they will help me.” But they caused him and all Israel to stumble.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>Ahaz gathered the items in God’s temple and removed them. He shut the doors of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple and erected altars on every street corner in Jerusalem.
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>In every city throughout Judah he set up high places to offer sacrifices to other gods. He angered the Lᴏʀᴅ God of his ancestors.
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>The rest of the events of Ahaz’s reign, including his accomplishments from start to finish, are recorded in the Scroll of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
###### 27
<span class=verse-body>27</span>Ahaz passed away and was buried in the city of Jerusalem; they did not bring him to the tombs of the kings of Israel. His son Hezekiah replaced him as king.
