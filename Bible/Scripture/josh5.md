###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>When all the Amorite kings on the west side of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings along the seacoast heard how the Lᴏʀᴅ had dried up the water of the Jordan before the Israelites while they crossed, they lost their courage and could not even breathe for fear of the Israelites.
## A New Generation is Circumcised
###### 2
<span class=verse-first>2</span>At that time the Lᴏʀᴅ told Joshua, “Make flint knives and circumcise the Israelites once again.”
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the Israelites at the Hill of the Foreskins.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>This is why Joshua had to circumcise them: All the men old enough to fight when they left Egypt died on the journey through the wilderness after they left Egypt.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>Now all the men who left were circumcised, but all the sons born on the journey through the wilderness after they left Egypt were uncircumcised.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>Indeed, for forty years the Israelites traveled through the wilderness until all the men old enough to fight when they left Egypt, the ones who had disobeyed the Lᴏʀᴅ, died off. For the Lᴏʀᴅ had sworn a solemn oath to them that he would not let them see the land he had sworn by oath to their ancestors to give them, a land rich in milk and honey.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>He replaced them with their sons, whom Joshua circumcised. They were uncircumcised; their fathers had not circumcised them along the way.

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>When all the men had been circumcised, they stayed there in the camp until they had healed.
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>The Lᴏʀᴅ said to Joshua, “Today I have taken away the disgrace of Egypt from you.” So that place is called Gilgal even to this day.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 10
<span class=verse-first>10</span>So the Israelites camped in Gilgal and celebrated the Passover in the evening of the fourteenth day of the month in the rift valley plains of Jericho.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>They ate some of the produce of the land the day after the Passover, including unleavened bread and roasted grain.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>The manna stopped appearing the day they ate some of the produce of the land; the Israelites never ate manna again. They ate from the produce of the land of Canaan that year.
## Israel Conquers Jericho
###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>When Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him holding a drawn sword. Joshua approached him and asked him, “Are you on our side or allied with our enemies?”
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>He answered, “Truly I am the commander of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s army. Now I have arrived!” Joshua bowed down with his face to the ground and asked, “What does my master want to say to his servant?”
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>The commander of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s army answered Joshua, “Remove your sandals from your feet, because the place where you stand is holy.” Joshua did so.
