###### 1
><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>Send rams as tribute to the ruler of the land,
>From Sela in the wilderness
>To the hill of Daughter Zion.
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>At the fords of the Arnon
>The Moabite women are like a bird
>That flies about when forced from its nest.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Bring a plan, make a decision.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Provide some shade in the middle of the day.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Hide the fugitives! Do not betray the one who tries to escape.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Please let the Moabite fugitives live among you.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Hide them from the destroyer!”
>Certainly the one who applies pressure will cease;
>The destroyer will come to an end;
>Those who trample will disappear from the earth.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Then a trustworthy king will be established;
>He will rule in a reliable manner,
>This one from David’s family.
>He will be sure to make just decisions
>And will be experienced in executing justice.

###### 6
><span class=verse-first-poetry>6</span>We have heard about Moab’s pride—
>Their great arrogance—
>Their boasting, pride, and excess.
>But their boastful claims are empty.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>So Moab wails over its demise—
>They all wail!
>Completely devastated, they moan
>About what has happened to the raisin cakes of Kir Hareseth.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>For the fields of Heshbon are dried up,
>As well as the vines of Sibmah.
>The rulers of the nations trample all over its vines,
>Which reach Jazer and spread to the wilderness;
>Their shoots spread out and cross the sea.
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span>So I weep along with Jazer
>Over the vines of Sibmah.
>I will saturate you with my tears, Heshbon and Elealeh,
>For the conquering invaders shout triumphantly
>Over your fruit and crops.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Joy and happiness disappear from the orchards,
>And in the vineyards no one rejoices or shouts;
>No one treads out juice in the wine vats—
>I have brought the joyful shouts to an end.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>So my heart constantly sighs for Moab, like the strumming of a harp,
>My inner being sighs for Kir Hareseth.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>When the Moabites plead with all their might at their high places,
>And enter their temples to pray, their prayers will be ineffective.
