###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Jeremiah finished telling all the people all these things the Lᴏʀᴅ their God had sent him to tell them.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>Then Azariah son of Hoshaiah, Johanan son of Kareah, and other arrogant men said to Jeremiah, “You are telling a lie! The Lᴏʀᴅ our God did not send you to tell us, ‘You must not go to Egypt and settle there.’
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>“But Baruch son of Neriah is stirring you up against us. He wants to hand us over to the Babylonians so that they will kill us or carry us off into exile in Babylon.”
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>So Johanan son of Kareah, all the army officers, and all the rest of the people did not obey the Lᴏʀᴅ’s command to stay in the land of Judah.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>Instead Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers led off all the Judean remnant who had come back to live in the land of Judah from all the nations where they had been scattered.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>They also led off all the men, women, children, and royal princesses that Nebuzaradan, the captain of the royal guard, had left with Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan; this included the prophet Jeremiah and Baruch son of Neriah.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>They went on to Egypt because they refused to obey the Lᴏʀᴅ, and came to Tahpanhes.

###### 8
<span class=verse-first>8</span>At Tahpanhes the Lord’s message came to Jeremiah:
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>“Take some large stones and bury them in the mortar of the clay pavement at the entrance of Pharaoh’s residence here in Tahpanhes. Do it while the people of Judah present there are watching.
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>“Then tell them, ‘The Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says, “I will bring my servant King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. I will set his throne over these stones that I have buried. He will pitch his royal tent over them.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>“He will come and attack Egypt. Those who are destined to die of disease will die of disease. Those who are destined to be carried off into exile will be carried off into exile. Those who are destined to die in war will die in war.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>“He will set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt. He will burn their gods or carry them off as captives. He will pick Egypt clean like a shepherd picks the lice from his clothing. He will leave there unharmed.
###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>“He will demolish the sacred pillars in the temple of the sun in Egypt and will burn down the temples of the gods of Egypt.”’”
