><span class=verse-first-poetry>1</span>How lovely is the place where you live,

###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span>I desperately want to be
>In the courts of the Lᴏʀᴅ’s temple.
>My heart and my entire being shout for joy
>To the living God.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Even the birds find a home there,

>Where she can protect her young
>Near your altars, O Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies,
>My King and my God.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>How blessed are those who live in your temple

###### 9

###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span>Certainly spending just one day in your temple courts is better
>Than spending a thousand elsewhere.
>I would rather stand at the entrance to the temple of my God
>Than live in the tents of the wicked.
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span>For the Lᴏʀᴅ God is our sovereign protector.
>The Lᴏʀᴅ bestows favor and honor;
>He withholds no good thing from those who have integrity.

><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span>O Lᴏʀᴅ of Heaven’s Armies,
