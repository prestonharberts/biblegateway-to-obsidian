## The Opening of the Scroll
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Then I saw in the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne a scroll written on the front and back and sealed with seven seals.
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>And I saw a powerful angel proclaiming in a loud voice: “Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?”
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or look into it.
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>So I began weeping bitterly because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>Then one of the elders said to me, “Stop weeping! Look, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has conquered; thus he can open the scroll and its seven seals.”

###### 6
<span class=verse-first>6</span>Then I saw standing in the middle of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the middle of the elders, a Lamb that appeared to have been killed. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.
###### 7
<span class=verse-body>7</span>Then he came and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne,
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>and when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders threw themselves to the ground before the Lamb. Each of them had a harp and golden bowls full of incense (which are the prayers of the saints).
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>They were singing a new song:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You are worthy to take the scroll
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And to open its seals
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because you were killed,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And at the cost of your own blood you have purchased for God
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Persons from every tribe, language, people, and nation.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You have appointed them as a kingdom and priests to serve our God, and they will reign on the earth.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
<span class=verse-first>11</span>Then I looked and heard the voice of many angels in a circle around the throne, as well as the living creatures and the elders. Their number was ten thousand times ten thousand—thousands times thousands—
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>all of whom were singing in a loud voice:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Worthy is the lamb who was killed
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To receive power and wealth
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And wisdom and might
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And honor and glory and praise!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
<span class=verse-body>13</span>Then I heard every creature—in heaven, on earth, under the earth, in the sea, and all that is in them—singing:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>To the one seated on the throne and to the Lamb
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Be praise, honor, glory, and ruling power forever and ever!”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>And the four living creatures were saying “Amen,” and the elders threw themselves to the ground and worshiped.
