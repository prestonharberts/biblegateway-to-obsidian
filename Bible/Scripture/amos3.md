## Every Effect has its Cause
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Listen, you Israelites, to this message that the Lᴏʀᴅ is proclaiming against you! This message is for the entire clan I brought up from the land of Egypt:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I have chosen you alone from all the clans of the earth.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Therefore I will punish you for all your sins.”
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span>Do two walk together without having met?
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span>Does a lion roar in the woods if he has not cornered his prey?
>Does a young lion bellow from his den if he has not caught something?
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span>Does a bird swoop down into a trap on the ground if there is no bait?
>Does a trap spring up from the ground unless it has surely caught something?
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span>If an alarm sounds in a city, do people not fear?
>If disaster overtakes a city, is the Lᴏʀᴅ not responsible?
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span>Certainly the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ does nothing without first revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.
###### 8
><span class=verse-body-poetry>8</span>A lion has roared! Who is not afraid?
>The Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ has spoken. Who can refuse to prophesy?
## Samaria Will Fall
###### 9
><span class=verse-first-poetry>9</span>Make this announcement in the fortresses of Ashdod
>And in the fortresses in the land of Egypt.
>Say this:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Gather on the hills around Samaria!
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Observe the many acts of violence taking place within the city,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The oppressive deeds occurring in it.”
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They do not know how to do what is right,” the Lᴏʀᴅ says.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They store up the spoils of destructive violence in their fortresses.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 11
><span class=verse-first-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Therefore,” says the Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ, “an enemy will encircle the land.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>He will take away your power;
>Your fortresses will be looted.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>This is what the Lᴏʀᴅ says:
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Just as a shepherd salvages from the lion’s mouth a couple of leg bones or a piece of an ear,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So the Israelites who live in Samaria will be salvaged.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They will be left with just a corner of a bed,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And a part of a couch.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Listen and warn the family of Jacob!”
>The Sovereign Lᴏʀᴅ, the God who commands armies, is speaking!
###### 14
><span class=verse-body-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Certainly when I punish Israel for their covenant transgressions,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will destroy Bethel’s altars.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will destroy both the winter and summer houses.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The houses filled with ivory will be ruined,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The great houses will be swept away.”
>The Lᴏʀᴅ is speaking!
