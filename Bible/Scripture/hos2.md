###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Then you will call your brother, “My People” (Ammi)! You will call your sister, “Pity” (Ruhamah)!
## Idolatrous Israel Will Be Punished Like a Prostitute
###### 2
><span class=verse-body-poetry>2</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Plead earnestly with your mother
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>(for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband),
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So that she might put an end to her adulterous lifestyle,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And turn away from her sexually immoral behavior.
###### 3
><span class=verse-body-poetry>3</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Otherwise, I will strip her naked,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And expose her like she was when she was born.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will turn her land into a wilderness
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And make her country a parched land,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So that I might kill her with thirst.
###### 4
><span class=verse-body-poetry>4</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will have no pity on her children,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Because they are children conceived in adultery.
###### 5
><span class=verse-body-poetry>5</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For their mother has committed adultery;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>She who conceived them has acted shamefully.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For she said, “I will seek out my lovers;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>They are the ones who give me my bread and my water,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>My wool, my flax, my olive oil, and my wine.”
## The Lord’s Discipline Will Bring Israel Back
###### 6
><span class=verse-body-poetry>6</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Therefore, I will soon fence her in with thorns;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will wall her in so that she cannot find her way.
###### 7
><span class=verse-body-poetry>7</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then she will pursue her lovers, but she will not catch them;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>She will seek them, but she will not find them.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then she will say,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will go back to my husband,
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Because I was better off then than I am now.’
## Agricultural Fertility Withdrawn from Israel
###### 8
><span class=verse-first-poetry>8</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Yet until now she has refused to acknowledge that I was the one
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Who gave her the grain, the new wine, and the olive oil;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And that it was I who lavished on her the silver and gold—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That they used in worshiping Baal!
###### 9
><span class=verse-body-poetry>9</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Therefore, I will take back my grain during the harvest time
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And my new wine when it ripens;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will take away my wool and my flax
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That I had provided in order to clothe her.
###### 10
><span class=verse-body-poetry>10</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Soon I will expose her lewd nakedness in front of her lovers,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And no one will be able to rescue her from me!
###### 11
><span class=verse-body-poetry>11</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will put an end to all her celebrations:
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Her annual religious festivals,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Monthly new moon celebrations,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And weekly Sabbath festivities—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>All her appointed festivals.
###### 12
><span class=verse-body-poetry>12</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will destroy her vines and fig trees,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>About which she said, ‘These are my wages for prostitution
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>That my lovers gave to me!’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will turn her cultivated vines and fig trees into an uncultivated thicket,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So that wild animals will devour them.
###### 13
><span class=verse-body-poetry>13</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will punish her for the festival days
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When she burned incense to the Baal idols;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>She adorned herself with earrings and jewelry,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And went after her lovers,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>But she forgot me!” says the Lᴏʀᴅ.
## Future Repentance and Restoration of Israel
###### 14
><span class=verse-first-poetry>14</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>However, in the future I will allure her;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will lead her back into the wilderness,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And speak tenderly to her.
###### 15
><span class=verse-body-poetry>15</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>From there I will give back her vineyards to her,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And turn the ‘Valley of Trouble’ into an ‘Opportunity for Hope.’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>There she will sing as she did when she was young,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>When she came up from the land of Egypt.
###### 16
><span class=verse-body-poetry>16</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>At that time,” declares the Lᴏʀᴅ,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will call, ‘My husband’;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>You will never again call me, ‘My master.’
###### 17
><span class=verse-body-poetry>17</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>For I will remove the names of the Baal idols from your lips,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>So that you will never again utter their names!”
## New Covenant Relationship with Repentant Israel
###### 18
><span class=verse-body-poetry>18</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>At that time I will make a covenant for them with the wild animals,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>The birds of the air, and the creatures that crawl on the ground.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will abolish the warrior’s bow and sword—
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>That is, every weapon of warfare—from the land,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And I will allow them to live securely.
###### 19
><span class=verse-body-poetry>19</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will commit myself to you forever;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will commit myself to you in righteousness and justice,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>In steadfast love and tender compassion.
###### 20
><span class=verse-body-poetry>20</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will commit myself to you in faithfulness;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then you will acknowledge the Lᴏʀᴅ.”
## Agricultural Fertility Restored to the Repentant Nation
###### 21
><span class=verse-first-poetry>21</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>At that time, I will willingly respond,” declares the Lᴏʀᴅ.
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will respond to the sky,
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And the sky will respond to the ground;
###### 22
><span class=verse-body-poetry>22</span><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>Then the ground will respond to the grain, the new wine, and the olive oil;
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And they will respond to ‘God Plants’ (Jezreel)!
###### 23
><span class=verse-body-poetry>23</span><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>Then I will plant her as my own in the land.
><span class=poetry-quote-single>‘</span>I will have pity on ‘No Pity’ (Lo-Ruhamah).
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>I will say to ‘Not My People’ (Lo-Ammi), ‘You are my people!’
><span class=poetry-quote-double>“</span>And he will say, ‘You are my God!’”
