## Joseph’s Wise Administration
###### 1
<span class=verse-first>1</span>Joseph went and told Pharaoh, “My father, my brothers, their flocks and herds, and all that they own have arrived from the land of Canaan. They are now in the land of Goshen.”
###### 2
<span class=verse-body>2</span>He took five of his brothers and introduced them to Pharaoh.
###### 3
<span class=verse-body>3</span>Pharaoh said to Joseph’s brothers, “What is your occupation?” They said to Pharaoh, “Your servants take care of flocks, just as our ancestors did.”
###### 4
<span class=verse-body>4</span>Then they said to Pharaoh, “We have come to live as temporary residents in the land. There is no pasture for your servants’ flocks because the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. So now, please let your servants live in the land of Goshen.”
###### 5
<span class=verse-body>5</span>Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Your father and your brothers have come to you.
###### 6
<span class=verse-body>6</span>“The land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best region of the land. They may live in the land of Goshen. If you know of any highly capable men among them, put them in charge of my livestock.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 7
<span class=verse-first>7</span>Then Joseph brought in his father Jacob and presented him before Pharaoh. Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
###### 8
<span class=verse-body>8</span>Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How long have you lived?”
###### 9
<span class=verse-body>9</span>Jacob said to Pharaoh, “All the years of my travels are 130. All the years of my life have been few and painful; the years of my travels are not as long as those of my ancestors.”
###### 10
<span class=verse-body>10</span>Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from his presence.
###### 11
<span class=verse-body>11</span>So Joseph settled his father and his brothers. He gave them territory in the land of Egypt, in the best region of the land, the land of Rameses, just as Pharaoh had commanded.
###### 12
<span class=verse-body>12</span>Joseph also provided food for his father, his brothers, and all his father’s household, according to the number of their little children.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 13
<span class=verse-first>13</span>But there was no food in all the land because the famine was very severe; the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan wasted away because of the famine.
###### 14
<span class=verse-body>14</span>Joseph collected all the money that could be found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan as payment for the grain they were buying. Then Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s palace.
###### 15
<span class=verse-body>15</span>When the money from the lands of Egypt and Canaan was used up, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, “Give us food! Why should we die before your very eyes because our money has run out?”
###### 16
<span class=verse-body>16</span>Then Joseph said, “If your money is gone, bring your livestock, and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock.”
###### 17
<span class=verse-body>17</span>So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them food in exchange for their horses, the livestock of their flocks and herds, and their donkeys. He got them through that year by giving them food in exchange for all their livestock.
###### 18
<span class=verse-body>18</span>When that year was over, they came to him the next year and said to him, “We cannot hide from our lord that the money is used up and the livestock and the animals belong to our lord. Nothing remains before our lord except our bodies and our land.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>“Why should we die before your very eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we, with our land, will become Pharaoh’s slaves. Give us seed that we may live and not die. Then the land will not become desolate.”
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 20
<span class=verse-first>20</span>So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh. Each of the Egyptians sold his field, for the famine was severe. So the land became Pharaoh’s.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>Joseph made all the people slaves from one end of Egypt’s border to the other end of it.
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>But he did not purchase the land of the priests because the priests had an allotment from Pharaoh and they ate from their allotment that Pharaoh gave them. That is why they did not sell their land.
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>Joseph said to the people, “Since I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh, here is seed for you. Cultivate the land.
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>“When the crop comes in, give one-fifth of it to Pharaoh. The remaining four-fifths will be yours for seed for the fields and for you to eat, including those in your households and your little children.”
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>They replied, “You have saved our lives! You are showing us favor, and we will be Pharaoh’s slaves.”
###### 26
<span class=verse-body>26</span>So Joseph made it a statute, which is in effect to this day throughout the land of Egypt: One-fifth belongs to Pharaoh. Only the land of the priests did not become Pharaoh’s.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 27
<span class=verse-first>27</span>Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen, and they owned land there. They were fruitful and increased rapidly in number.
###### 28
<span class=verse-body>28</span>Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; the years of Jacob’s life were 147 in all.
<div class=paragraph-break></div>

###### 29
<span class=verse-first>29</span>The time for Israel to die approached, so he called for his son Joseph and said to him, “If now I have found favor in your sight, put your hand under my thigh and show me kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt,
###### 30
<span class=verse-body>30</span>“but when I rest with my fathers, carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place.” Joseph said, “I will do as you say.”
###### 31
<span class=verse-body>31</span>Jacob said, “Swear to me that you will do so.” So Joseph gave him his word. Then Israel bowed down at the head of his bed.
