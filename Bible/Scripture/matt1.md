## The Birth of Jesus Christ
###### 18
<span class=verse-first>18</span>Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened this way. While his mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit.
###### 19
<span class=verse-body>19</span>Because Joseph, her husband to be, was a righteous man, and because he did not want to disgrace her, he intended to divorce her privately.
###### 20
<span class=verse-body>20</span>When he had contemplated this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, because the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
###### 21
<span class=verse-body>21</span>“She will give birth to a son and you will name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”
###### 22
<span class=verse-body>22</span>This all happened so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet would be fulfilled:
###### 23
<span class=verse-body>23</span>“Look! The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will name him Emmanuel,” which means “God with us.”
###### 24
<span class=verse-body>24</span>When Joseph awoke from sleep he did what the angel of the Lord told him. He took his wife,
###### 25
<span class=verse-body>25</span>but did not have marital relations with her until she gave birth to a son, whom he named Jesus.
